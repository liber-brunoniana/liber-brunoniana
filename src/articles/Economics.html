<p>Economics was introduced as “political economy” by <a href="articles/Wayland, Francis.html">Francis Wayland</a> in <a href="articles/1828.html">1828</a>. <a href="articles/Gammell, William.html">William Gammell</a> taught history and political economy from <a href="articles/1850.html">1850</a> to <a href="articles/1864.html">1864</a>, followed by J. Lewis Diman from <a href="articles/1864.html">1864</a> to <a href="articles/1881.html">1881</a>. The teaching of political economy continued as a subordinate duty of the history professor until late in the nineteenth century. When E. Benjamin Andrews resigned as professor of history, it was decided that the professorship of history and political economy should be divided into two parts. Henry Brayton Gardner was appointed associate professor of political economy in <a href="articles/1888.html">1888</a>, and a separate Department of Political Economy was first listed in the catalogue in <a href="articles/1889.html">1889</a>. The change of name to Department of Economics took place in <a href="articles/1906.html">1906</a>.</p><p>When Professor Diman reported on his class in political economy in <a href="articles/1869.html">1869</a>, he stated that “Instruction has been by lectures, and has included a general introduction to the study with an examination of the laws of Production, Exchange, Distribution and Consumption. The general design of the course has been to demonstate that wealth accumulates strictly in accordance with natural laws; that the interests of society are harmonious; and that all restrictions upon exchange are injurious.” The subject matter of economics has enlarged considerably since that time. A more timely definition is that economics is the study of rational decision making in the allocation of scarce productive resources among alternative goals. In the twentieth century students were beginning to ask for business courses, and in <a href="articles/1916.html">1916</a> the University responded, first, by the presentation of a series of lectures sponsored by Edgar L. Marston on South American business and trade, and, second, by entering into cooperation with the National Bank as one of a group of selected universities invited to recommend each year three seniors and three juniors or sophomores to be trained by the bank for future service in its foreign branches.</p><p>In the 1920s the department grew through the addition of faculty members <a href="articles/Adams, James P..html">James P.

The Brown Bureau of Business Research was formed in <a href="articles/1921.html">1921</a> by the Providence Chamber of Commerce and the Brown Department of Economics for the purpose of effecting a close business contact between Rhode Island business and the department. This came about largely through the initiative of Professor Ralph E. Badger of the Economics Department, who interested several prominent business men in the project. Its articles of agreement defined its primary purpose as the maintenance and operation of a research laboratory to study problems relating to commerce and industry in metropolitan Providence. In <a href="articles/1924.html">1924</a> the Bureau inaugurated its official publication, <i>Brown Business Service,</i> subtitled “Analyses of Economic Conditions in Southeastern New England,” for distribution of timely information to the business community monthly from September to July. In <a href="articles/1927.html">1927</a>-28 the Bureau cooperated with the Division of Industrial and Municipal Research at M.I.T. in the industrial survey of metropolitan Providence. The Bureau continued as an agency of the University until <a href="articles/1939.html">1939</a>. In <a href="articles/1932.html">1932</a> a grant was received from the Rockefeller Foundation for a study of the international gold standard under the direction of William Adams Brown and Carel J.

In <a href="articles/1952.html">1952</a> Brown entered into cooperation with a newly appointed Business Executives’ Research Committee from the community to study the economic problems of Rhode Island with grants from the nationwide Committee for Economic Development and the Ford Foundation’s Fund for Adult <a href="articles/Education.html">Education</a>. These studies were conducted by Professor <a href="articles/Stoltz, Merton P..html">Merton P. Stoltz</a>, who had joined the department in <a href="articles/1940.html">1940</a>.

Brennan in <a href="articles/1957.html">1957</a>, Phillip D. Cagan in <a href="articles/1958.html">1958</a>, and Martin J. Beckmann and Mark B. Schupack in <a href="articles/1959.html">1959</a>. In <a href="articles/1958.html">1958</a> the department received a grant from the Ford Foundation to study regional economic development in the United States. The study was carried out jointly by Professors George H. Borts and Jerome Stein. A graduate program in regional economic development was established. In <a href="articles/1963.html">1963</a> the department received a grant from the Ford Foundation to study the economics of aging.
