<p>George Ide Chace (<a href="articles/1808.html">1808</a>-<a href="articles/1885.html">1885</a>), professor of many subjects and president <i>ad interim</i> in <a href="articles/1867.html">1867</a>-68, was born on February 19, <a href="articles/1808.html">1808</a> in Lancaster, Massachusetts, where he lived on a farm. At the age of ten he fell from the roof of a building which was being repaired, and during the long convalescence which followed, he began to study with an older brother. He determined to continue his education, and after his recovery was sent to Lancaster Academy to prepare for college. He entered Brown in <a href="articles/1827.html">1827</a> as a sophomore and graduated in <a href="articles/1830.html">1830</a>, at which time he delivered a <a href="articles/Commencement.html">Commencement</a> address on “The Results of Improvements in the Science of <a href="articles/Education.html">Education</a>.” After graduation he was principal of the Waterville Classical Institute for a year, before returning to Brown as a tutor. He was appointed adjunct professor of mathematics and natural philosophy in <a href="articles/1833.html">1833</a>, and professor of chemistry in <a href="articles/1834.html">1834</a>. <a href="articles/President.html">President</a> <a href="articles/Wayland, Francis.html">Francis Wayland</a>, who had been teaching a physiology course, sent Chace to Philadelphia to attend lectures, after which he was appointed professor of chemistry, physiology, and geology in <a href="articles/1836.html">1836</a>. In the summer of <a href="articles/1836.html">1836</a> he traveled through Virginia and Kentucky to acquire geological specimens. For several years students, both male and female, in the higher classes of the Providence High School were permitted to attend his chemistry classes. In <a href="articles/1853.html">1853</a> he gave a series of lectures to a class of 330 manufacturing jewelers of Providence and was rewarded by a gift of a silver pitcher engraved with scenes of <a href="articles/Rhode Island Hall.html">Rhode Island Hall</a>, the laboratory, and jewelers at work. As Chace’s responsibilities changed, so did his titles. He became professor of chemistry and physiology in <a href="articles/1859.html">1859</a>, professor of geology and physical geography in <a href="articles/1864.html">1864</a>, and professor of chemistry and geology in <a href="articles/1865.html">1865</a>.</p><p>He served as president <i>ad interim</i> for six months after the resignation of <a href="articles/President.html">President</a> <a href="articles/Sears, Barnas.html">Barnas Sears</a> in <a href="articles/1867.html">1867</a>, adding the teaching of metaphysics and ethics to his regular classes, and was thought by many to be the best choice to succeed Sears. When <a href="articles/Caswell, Alexis.html">Alexis Caswell</a> became president in <a href="articles/1868.html">1868</a>, Chace was named professor of moral and intellectual philosophy, courses which had usually been taught by the president. Chace was essentially a scientist, rather than a philosopher. His courses in physiology and in intellectual philosophy recognized the relationship between physiology and psychology, and in <a href="articles/1848.html">1848</a> he published an article, “On the dependence of the mental powers upon the bodily organization.” James B. Angell <a href="articles/1849.html">1849</a> said of Chace, “He was one of the few men who could talk well while conducting an experiment.”</p><p>In <a href="articles/1869.html">1869</a> Chace began a tradition of inviting to his home on Benefit Street all the members of his senior class in mental philosophy in groups of four or five for a social evening. This custom was highly approved by the students. After his resignation from teaching in <a href="articles/1871.html">1871</a>, Chace traveled to Europe, and then returned and added to his civic responsibilities. He was a trustee of Butler Hospital and Rhode Island Hospital, and from <a href="articles/1874.html">1874</a> to <a href="articles/1883.html">1883</a> was chairman of the State Board of Charities and Corrections, directing the state institutions in Cranston. He died in Providence on April 29, <a href="articles/1885.html">1885</a>. <a href="articles/Bronson, Walter C..html">Walter C. Bronson</a> <a href="articles/1887.html">1887</a> wrote of Chace:</p><blockquote>“Yet with all his gifts Professor Chace was not a popular man. His manner was reserved, almost to coldness, and in class he was severe and sometimes caustic; although in his later years he cultivated closer and more friendly relations with his pupils. A man of deep convictions and a lifelong member of the Baptist denomination, he yet was disliked by religious conservatives: to the zealous he seemed cold and to the rigidly orthodox dangerously rationalistic, although in his later years, like his friend Agassiz, he withheld assent from the doctrine of evolution. His supposed theological unsoundness and the fact that he was not a clergyman were the main reasons, it is said, for the opposition to him as a canddisappointment he remained loyal to the college, and in his will left $9000 for two scholarships which bear his name.”</blockquote>Another legacy was a free bed for Brown University at Rhode Island Hospital.
