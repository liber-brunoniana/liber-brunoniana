<p>Songs of Brown University have been sung since the middle nineteenth century when students gathered on the steps of <a href="articles/Manning Hall.html">Manning Hall</a> to sing. With student singers in mind James A. DeWolf <a href="articles/1861.html">1861</a> wrote for the <i><a href="articles/Brown Paper.html">Brown Paper</a></i> of <a href="articles/1860.html">1860</a> a song called “Old Brown,” which was renamed “<a href="articles/Alma Mater.html">Alma Mater</a>” in <a href="articles/1869.html">1869</a>, and is well known. In <a href="articles/1891.html">1891</a> John B. Barbour <a href="articles/1891.html">1891</a>, Edward B. Birge <a href="articles/1891.html">1891</a>, and Arthur H. Colby <a href="articles/1891.html">1891</a> compiled <i>Songs of Brown University,</i> a collection of songs, mostly written by the students. When Alfred G. Chaffee ’02 and Ralph W. McPhee ’07 compiled another songbook with the same title in <a href="articles/1908.html">1908</a>, they included not only the songs about Brown, but also the old familiar tunes that Brown men sang. Some of the songs written in celebration of Brown were “Mother Dear, <a href="articles/Brunonia.html">Brunonia</a>” and “Hail, <a href="articles/Brunonia.html">Brunonia</a>,” both with words by Henry R. Palmer <a href="articles/1890.html">1890</a>, “On the <a href="articles/Chapel.html">Chapel</a> Steps,” by Joel N. Eno <a href="articles/1883.html">1883</a> and George C. Gow <a href="articles/1884.html">1884</a>, “Bruno,” by A. G. Chaffee ’02, “God Bless Our University,” with words by Henry R. Palmer <a href="articles/1890.html">1890</a> and music by Jules Jordan, and “Bring the Victory to Brown,” by Donald Jackson ’09. In <a href="articles/1921.html">1921</a> another songbook, also entitled <i>Songs of Brown University</i> was edited by <a href="articles/Hastings, William T..html">William T. Hastings</a> ’03 and <a href="articles/Appleget, Thomas B..html">Thomas B. Appleget</a> ’17. Professor <a href="articles/Everett, Walter G..html">Walter G. Everett</a> wrote a <a href="articles/Commencement.html">Commencement</a> song while he was at Aigle, Switzerland, during the <a href="articles/Commencement.html">Commencement</a> season of <a href="articles/1922.html">1922</a>. Everett said he had no plan to write a song, but all day his thoughts turned to the Brown commencement and at night amid the beauty of his surroundings in Switzerland the words of the song came to him. On his return to Brown he showed his song to <a href="articles/President.html">President</a> Faunce. It was first sung at <a href="articles/Commencement.html">Commencement</a> in <a href="articles/1923.html">1923</a>.</p><p>There were songs which were inspired by specific occasions at Brown, as the “Boating Song” by Adoniram Brown Judson <a href="articles/1859.html">1859</a>, a member of the first crew, and “The Water Procession,” by Francis E. Bliss <a href="articles/1868.html">1868</a> and Francis Lawton <a href="articles/1869.html">1869</a>, which commemorated the march downtown to get water when the bucket of the college well was removed by the authorities in <a href="articles/1867.html">1867</a>-68. “Bylo,” a song borrowed and arranged by Alfred G. Chafee ’02, appeared in the <a href="articles/1908.html">1908</a> songbook, with this verse, “I bought a rooster for fifty cents, B-R-O-double-U-N, The son-of-a-gun jumped over the fence,” followed by the chorus, “Bylo, my Baby, B-R-O-double U-N ...” and later, with other verses, became a popular party song. The best known songs of Brown are:</p><p><h2>Ever True to Brown</h2><br />by Donald Jackson ’09</p><blockquote>We are ever true to Brown,<br />For we love our college dear,<br />And wherever we may go,<br />We are ready with a cheer,<br />And the people always say,<br />That you can’t outshine Brown Men,<br />With their Rah! Rah! Rah!<br />And their Ki! Yi! Yi!<br />And their B-R-O-double U-N!</blockquote><h2>Ki-Yi-Yi</h2><br />Words by W. A. Hart ’03<br /><a href="articles/Music.html">Music</a> by E. W. Corliss <a href="articles/1895.html">1895</a><blockquote>We’re loyal sons of good old Brown,<br />We’re out to do or die,<br />And cheer our team to vict’ry<br />With our Ki-Yi-Yi.<br />Our team is made of heroes bold<br />Who aren’t afraid to try,<br />And we are right behind them with our Ki-Yi-Yi.<br />Ki-Yi-Yi! Come and give a good and lusty Ki-Yi-Yi!<br />For our team so tried and trusty,<br />Ki-Yi-Yi, boys!<br />Come – Now, Give them a good snappy Ki-Yi-Yi!</blockquote>“Ki-Yi-Yi” was written on one fall day in <a href="articles/1902.html">1902</a> after a chance remark of Steve Waterman Mason ’05 to William A. Hart ’03 that a new Brown song was needed. Hart immediately wrote some lyrics and they took them to Edward Corliss to have them set to music. This collaboration resulted in the completion of the song that afternoon and its first performance by the band at the football game the next week. It was first printed in the <a href="articles/1903.html">1903</a> <i><a href="articles/Liber Brunensis.html">Liber Brunensis</a>.</i><p><h2>The Brown <a href="articles/Cheering.html">Cheering</a> Song</h2><br />Words by Robert B.
