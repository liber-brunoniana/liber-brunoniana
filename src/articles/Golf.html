<p>Golf became accessible to Brown students in October <a href="articles/1901.html">1901</a>, when a change in the constitution of the Metacomet Club in East Providence provided that members of the newly formed Brown Golf Club would be admitted to the Metacomet Club without further recommendation. This was accomplished through the interest of Brown faculty members who belonged to the Metacomet Club. Professor <a href="articles/Potter, Albert K..html">Albert K. Potter</a> was elected the first president of the Brown Golf Club. In <a href="articles/1903.html">1903</a> Brown won the New England intercollegiate golf tournament at the Wannamoisett Club, defeating Amherst and M.I.T.

Roland Mackenzie ’29, an accomplished golfer before he came to Brown, was named to the U.S. Walker Cup team as a freshman. After taking time off from college and improving his strength by working as a lumberjack, he returned to play with the <a href="articles/1928.html">1928</a> team and finish second in the Intercollegiate tournament that year.

The next season’s record was 6-5, and the team finished fourth in the <a href="articles/Ivy League.html">Ivy League</a> and seventh of fifteen in the New England tournament. Funding for golf as a varsity sport was withdrawn in <a href="articles/1991.html">1991</a> as part of the University’s budget reduction. Among the golf coaches have been Frank S.
