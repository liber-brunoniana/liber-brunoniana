On the occasion of his death, Professor Faunce wrote in his annual report, “James Irving Manatt was an old-fashioned scholar, of large horizon and boundless and contagious enthusiasm. He never lost the forest in the trees. He was a Grecian who never gave his life to the dative case, but to the Greek ideals, ancient and modern. His thorough study of the classic writers was supplemented by long residence in Greece, and no one who has seen him, as I have, by the banks of the Ilissus, in the shadow of the Acropolis, or on the shore of the Bay of Salamis, can ever forget how he had become saturated with Greek literature and life.”</p>
