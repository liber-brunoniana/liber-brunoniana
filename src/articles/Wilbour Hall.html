<p>Wilbour Hall on the corner of Prospect and George Streets was formerly the Dorrance mansion, owned and occupied by Delta Phi fraternity and since <a href="articles/1949.html">1949</a> the home of the Department of <a href="articles/Egyptology.html">Egyptology</a>. It was named for Charles Edwin Wilbour <a href="articles/1854.html">1854</a>, in whose memory a chair of <a href="articles/Egyptology.html">Egyptology</a> was established by his daughter. The original plans for the Rockefeller <a href="articles/Library.html">Library</a> included the razing of Wilbour Hall, but the plans were changed to accommodate Professor <a href="articles/Neugebauer, Otto.html">Otto Neugebauer</a>, whose office was in the building and who had been quoted as saying, if asked to move his books once more, he would move them to Princeton. Wilbour Hall was saved, and it was later revealed that Neugebauerâ€™s statement was only a well-placed rumor instigated by another resident of the building, Egyptologist Richard Parker.</p>
