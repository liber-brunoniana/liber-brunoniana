<p>The Civil War brought about changes on the campus. Excerpts from the diary of Henry S. Burrage <a href="articles/1861.html">1861</a> recorded the events at Brown occasioned by the attack on Fort Sumter on April 12, <a href="articles/1861.html">1861</a>:</p><blockquote>“Monday, April 15. The seniors had a meeting after the Dr.’s recitation, and appointed a committee to obtain permission to raise the stars and stripes over the college building. The Dr. assented and as soon as the flag staff can be erected and the flag secured the national ensign will wave over halls which once served as barracks for the heroes of the Revolution. ... Ward of Mississippi seemed very much excited at the meeting – moved to raise the flag of the C.S.A. &amp; after voting ‘No!’ on the principal motion seceded.”<p>Wed. Apr. 17. A day long to be remembered in college! The stars and stripes were raised over Univ. Hall this afternoon in the presence of the faculty and undergraduates of the college and also of a large throng of spectators from the city. Hardly had the music died away when the starry folds of our national ensign were seen ascending the flag staff which had been erected over Uni. Hall. It was greeted with cheer on cheer from every part of the college green. The band then played the ‘Star Spangled Banner.’ Dr. Sears then stepped forward and made the opening address. He was followed by Bishop Clark, Rev. Dr. Hall, Rev. Dr. Caldwell, and Ex-Governor Dyer, all of whom made stirring patriotic speeches. After Dr. Hall’s speech the students sang America ... Everybody pronounced the affair a thrilling success. Certainly it was the proudest day I have known in college.”</p></blockquote><p>Fifteen undergraduates enlisted for three months in the first Rhode Island Regiment. The first detachment left Providence on April 20, and Professor Gammell dismissed the seniors to see the troops off. When the second detachment left four days later, former <a href="articles/President.html">President</a> <a href="articles/Wayland, Francis.html">Francis Wayland</a> addressed the troops in Exchange Place. When the second Rhode Island regiment formed in May, only three students joined. Students who stayed behind began drilling in the late afternoon at the armory of the National Cadets. On May 11 a meeting of undergraduates voted to form a military company and “voted that it should be called ‘The Wrath of Achilles,’ but the vote was afterwards reconsidered,” and the company was named merely the University Cadets, who by June 8 were able to “parade in their new uniforms, dark blue shirts, light blue Zouave pants, red cap.” The only active service the Cadets, as Company I, Rhode Island Militia, saw occurred in the early summer of <a href="articles/1863.html">1863</a>. A rebel privateer, the Taconey, had appeared off the coast and rumors that it would sail up Narragansett Bay to Providence caused the deployment of the Marine Corps of Artillery to the west side of the west passage, called the “Bonnet.”  A company of infantry was also needed, and the cadets were eager to go, especially as they would miss their examinations. For fourteen days they built fortifications and did guard duty. When the danger passed, each received his $5.63 private’s pay, and they all presented “resolutions” to the faculty that they be excused from the examinations they had missed. The result was that they were required to take the examinations at the beginning of the next term. They did, however, enjoy a little song, of which one verse was:</p><blockquote>We won’t pass examinations,<br />Oh, no! not we, not we.<br />We all went down to West Passage<br />for five and sixty-three.</blockquote><p>In Henry Burrage’s book, <i>Brown University in the Civil War,</i> are listed the names of 294 alumni and students who served in the Union ranks, 26 of them before entering the University.
