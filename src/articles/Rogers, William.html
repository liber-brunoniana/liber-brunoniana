He was at that time fourteen years old and had studied under the Reverend Aaron Hutchinson of Grafton, Massachusetts. He was the only student until June 10, <a href="articles/1766.html">1766</a>, when Richard Stites, young brother-in-law of <a href="articles/President.html">President</a> Manning, enrolled. At the first <a href="articles/Commencement.html">Commencement</a> in <a href="articles/1769.html">1769</a> he delivered an “oration on benevolence.” He taught for a while in Newport, was baptized by Gardner Thurston of Newport in <a href="articles/1770.html">1770</a>, and licensed to preach in August of <a href="articles/1771.html">1771</a>. In December of that year he left the Newport academy of which he was principal and went to Philadelphia. He was called to succeed <a href="articles/Edwards, Morgan.html">Morgan Edwards</a> as pastor of the Baptist Church there and was ordained on May 31, <a href="articles/1772.html">1772</a>.

After he ended his military service in June <a href="articles/1781.html">1781</a>, he was approached by three different churches (of three different denominations), but declined any appointment, preferring to supply destitute churches in the Philadelphia area. In <a href="articles/1784.html">1784</a> he was called upon to perform a service for his <a href="articles/Alma Mater.html">Alma Mater</a>, that of procuring in Philadelphia the new seal of the College which was to replace the colonial seal which bore the images of the King and Queen of England.

He resigned his professorship in the University of Pennsylvania in <a href="articles/1812.html">1812</a>, attributing his departure to “Arbitrary Resolutions of its Trustees to which they were instigated by the restless and ambitious spirit of a despotical <a href="articles/Provost.html">Provost</a> John Andrews.” He had numerous other interests, being at various times vice-president of the Pennsylvania society for the gradual abolition of slavery; vice-president of the Philadelphia society for alleviating the miseries of public prisons; chaplain of the Philadelphia militia legion; and a member of the Pennsylvania legislature.
