Planned by Gavin Hadden of New York with Paul Cret as supervising architect, it was built by Turner Construction Company of New York at a cost of $350,000. The amphitheatre design selected provided seats for 27,646 persons – 16,400 in the south stand, 3,982 in the north stand, and 7,264 in temporary wooden stands. Original planning had anticipated that some day the north stand for visitors would be enlarged to the size of the south stand, making the capacity 32,000.
