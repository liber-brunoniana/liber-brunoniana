After a few losing seasons, the team had four winning seasons from <a href="articles/1930.html">1930</a> through <a href="articles/1933.html">1933</a>, before a decline which lasted until the sport was dropped in <a href="articles/1937.html">1937</a> during the Depression. Henry Letoile began coaching in <a href="articles/1933.html">1933</a>. That year Roger Elton ’33 led the team to six victories in ten games and was named to the All American lacrosse team.
