<p>Andrews Field was opened for athletic events on May 6, <a href="articles/1899.html">1899</a>. The property, nearly seven acres between Camp and Ivy Streets, was acquired in <a href="articles/1897.html">1897</a> through the bequest of John Wilson Smith. The field was named for <a href="articles/President.html">President</a> Andrews, who had resigned in <a href="articles/1898.html">1898</a>. William H. G. Temple was the architect of the plan which made the utmost use of the available land with the juxtaposition of the football field and the baseball diamond, in which second base was on the goal line. Around the playing fields was the quarter mile track, with six hydrants placed so that the entire track could be watered with 100 feet of hose. The field was enclosed by a 10-foot fence, 2,110 feet in length. The grandstand, designed after the pattern of Soldiersâ€™ Field at Harvard, had seating for 1,200 people, with one section for 500 which could be dismantled and reassembled in season at the football field, where a permanent grandstand would have interfered with baseball play. A small structure, painted red and green and outfitted with hot and cold water and showers, was erected near Camp Street. It was replaced by the <a href="articles/Marston Field House.html">Marston Field House</a> in <a href="articles/1907.html">1907</a>. A new football stand erected by the Athletic Association in <a href="articles/1910.html">1910</a> increased the seating capacity by 1,050, and in October of that year a large Irwin scoreboard was installed. Andrews Field was superseded in <a href="articles/1925.html">1925</a> by the new stadium on Elmgrove Avenue and the baseball field named <a href="articles/Aldrich Field.html">Aldrich Field</a>, across the street from the stadium.</p>
