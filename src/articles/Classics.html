In Greek, the new Testament, Lucians Dialogues &amp; Zenophon’s Cyropaedia; – For the second year, in Latin, Cicero de Oratore and Caesars Commentaries; – In Greek, Homer’s Iliad &amp; Longinus on the Sublime ...” At first the teaching of Latin and Greek was performed by the president. <a href="articles/Messer, Asa.html">Asa Messer</a> was professor of learned languages from <a href="articles/1790.html">1790</a> to <a href="articles/1796.html">1796</a> before he became president, and presumably continued in that capacity until <a href="articles/Park, Calvin.html">Calvin Park</a> was named to that professorship in <a href="articles/1804.html">1804</a>. Park’s title was changed in <a href="articles/1811.html">1811</a> to professor of moral philosophy and metaphysics, but he also probably continued his usual instruction in languages, since no replacement was appointed until he left the University in <a href="articles/1825.html">1825</a>. <a href="articles/Elton, Romeo.html">Romeo Elton</a> was professor of Latin and Greek languages and literature from <a href="articles/1825.html">1825</a> to <a href="articles/1843.html">1843</a>, with Horatio Balch Hackett as adjunct professor from <a href="articles/1835.html">1835</a> to <a href="articles/1838.html">1838</a>. James Robinson Boise taught Greek from <a href="articles/1843.html">1843</a> to <a href="articles/1852.html">1852</a>, with the exception of <a href="articles/1850.html">1850</a>-51, when Hiram H.

Required courses in Greek ended in the sophomore year, but in <a href="articles/1856.html">1856</a> an elective course in Greek was added in the junior year. In <a href="articles/1871.html">1871</a> and again in <a href="articles/1876.html">1876</a> seniors requested an elective course, which became a regular course in <a href="articles/1878.html">1878</a>. When <a href="articles/Harkness, Albert 1842.html">Albert Harkness</a> was granted a leave of absence to spend the year <a href="articles/1870.html">1870</a>-71 in Europe, two instructors were hired, <a href="articles/Poland, William Carey.html">William Carey Poland</a> <a href="articles/1868.html">1868</a> to teach Greek to the freshman and sophomore classes, and <a href="articles/Williams, Alonzo.html">Alonzo Williams</a> <a href="articles/1870.html">1870</a> to teach Greek and Latin to the freshman class. In the second term of <a href="articles/1890.html">1890</a>-91 Thomas Chase, former president of Haverford College, taught Greek courses for seniors and juniors. The Class of <a href="articles/1888.html">1888</a> as seniors donated funds for the acquisition of a collection of casts from Greek and Roman sculpture which was placed in a room on the first floor of <a href="articles/Manning Hall.html">Manning Hall</a>.

Professor <a href="articles/Harkness, Albert 1842.html">Albert Harkness</a> retired in <a href="articles/1892.html">1892</a> and was replaced by <a href="articles/Manatt, James Irving.html">James Irving Manatt</a>, who was professor of Greek literature and history from <a href="articles/1892.html">1892</a> to <a href="articles/1915.html">1915</a>. Manatt was in Europe when Harkness resigned, and Greek was under the direction of Thomas Chase, and after Chase’s illness, under Henry T. Hildreth. A coeducational Classical Club met at Professor Manatt’s house in the 1890s. There, in the spring of <a href="articles/1894.html">1894</a>, a cast of both men and women students preformed Sophocles’ <i>Antigone.</i> On November 31, <a href="articles/1897.html">1897</a>, a performance in Greek of <i>The Return of Odysseus</i> at <a href="articles/Pembroke Hall.html">Pembroke Hall</a> included a hymn to Apollo, which had been discovered at Delphi by Professor Manatt. <a href="articles/Allinson, Francis Greenleaf.html">Francis Greenleaf Allinson</a> was associate professor of Greek and classical philology from <a href="articles/1895.html">1895</a> to <a href="articles/1898.html">1898</a>, after which he was the David Benedict Professor of Greek literature and history from <a href="articles/1898.html">1898</a> to <a href="articles/1927.html">1927</a>.</p><p>The first Ph.D. degree in Latin was earned in <a href="articles/1895.html">1895</a> by Charles E.

In <a href="articles/1928.html">1928</a> the department moved from lower Manning to the third floor of <a href="articles/University Hall.html">University Hall</a>. At about there arrived three faculty members, who were to man the department for the next three decades. <a href="articles/Lynch, Charles Arthur.html">Charles Arthur Lynch</a> and <a href="articles/Robinson, Charles Alexander.html">Charles Alexander Robinson</a>, Jr. both arrived as instructors in <a href="articles/1927.html">1927</a>, and Herbert N.

The Latin or Greek requirement for the Bachelor of Arts degree was removed by vote of the <a href="articles/Corporation.html">Corporation</a> in <a href="articles/1934.html">1934</a>. The <i>Providence Journal</i> observed, “This movement in our American colleges does not mean that Greek and Latin culture is ungratefully thrown overboard, but rather that it has been so largely absorbed into modern civilization that it may be taught in introductory courses without the use of the original languages.... The lovers of literature and the professors of literature will still read Greek and Latin.... So the classic tongues, if no longer required of all in our colleges, will not be given up. Being taken for love and not on compulsion, they will be taught and learned better than ever. Lovers of them need have no regrets over the action taken at Brown. Greek and Latin are henceforth in the hands only of their friends.” The name of the department was changed in <a href="articles/1945.html">1945</a> from Department of Greek and Latin Classics to Department of Classics.</p><p>In <a href="articles/1948.html">1948</a> the department presented the first of its very popular Latin Christmas Carol Services. Professor Herbert N. Couch, head of the department, announced the program with an explanation that the members of the department “regard the service as one of good cheer in a scholarly mood, imbued with the traditions and loyalties of centuries long past, recalled for a brief hour in an academic atmosphere not unworthy of its place in that gracious succession of learning.” The audience joined in the singing of the well-known Latin carol, “Adestes Fideles” (“O Come, All Ye Faithful”), as well as others, such as “Ornate Aulas” (“Deck the Halls”), “Rex iam Wenceslas” (“Good King Wenceslas”), and heard a rendition of “Duodecim Dies Natalis” (“The Twelve Days of Christmas”), translated into Latin by Eunice Burr Couch and performed by “Grex Chattertockarum,” the Chattertocks. Professor <a href="articles/Workman, John Rowe.html">John Rowe Workman</a> took over the direction of the very popular carol service and for many years discoursed in perfect Latin on such diverse subjects as the curriculum and hockey (of which he was very fond as faculty advisor to the team). The service continues under the direction of Professor William F. Wyatt.</p><p><a href="articles/Robinson, Charles Alexander.html">Charles Alexander Robinson</a> headed Brown’s first excavation program in Corinth in the summer of <a href="articles/1959.html">1959</a>.

Ross Holloway excavated a site in Athens in <a href="articles/1965.html">1965</a> and commenced the excavation of Satrianum in Lucania in <a href="articles/1966.html">1966</a>. Brown-sponsored excavations continue in Italy (Ustica) and Greece (Corfu).</p><p>The standard concentration patterns in Classics are classics, classical archaeology, Greek, Latin, Greek and Latin, and classics and Sanskrit.
