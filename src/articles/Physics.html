<p>Physics had a place in the curriculum in the earliest days of the College, when it was known as “natural philosophy.” Entries of the diary of <a href="articles/Drowne, Solomon.html">Solomon Drowne</a> <a href="articles/1773.html">1773</a> describe experimental work in natural philosophy.</p><p></p><blockquote>“Aug 3 <a href="articles/1772.html">1772</a>  This morning at about 8 the senior and junior classes go down to Mr. Brown’s apparatus at the works to attend electrical and <i>Philosophycal</i> lectures. Mr. Howell present. In the forenoon and part of the afternoon try electrical experiments. Kill a pigeon, etc. Then darken the room to construct the camera obscura which affords very pretty diversion as some go out and ride, play, etc. and David ^Ebenezer David <a href="articles/1772.html">1772</a>, later a Baptist clergyman and chaplain in the <a href="articles/Revolutionary War.html">Revolutionary War</a>` stands upon his head. We then carry out the telescope and micrometer up on the hill and look at the sun as long as we could see him, then at the moon, then stars, and lastly the planet Jupiter, 3 of whose moons we see.<p>“Aug. 4th.  This morning at 8 we go again to the apparatus. In the first place we fill a globe with water which is hung up in a darkened room with only a hole in the window shutter to let a ray shine upon the globe, which after a refraction and reflection or two exhibits a rainbow; but our globe falls in the midst of the experiment, not being well suspended. Next we demonstrate the theory of light and colors with a very neat prism: Then we fix the camera obscura or solar microscope which magnifies objects amazingly. A louse is made to appear six feet long in which we could plainly discern the peristaltic motion. Lastly we see water ascend in capillary tubes which concludes the experiments.”</p></blockquote>The annual catalogue for <a href="articles/1823.html">1823</a> listed Enfield’s <i>Institute of Natural <a href="articles/Philosophy.html">Philosophy</a></i> in the curriculum for the junior year. In the <a href="articles/1829.html">1829</a> catalogue the studies mentioned in the junior year were mechanics, pneumatics, hydrostatics, optics, and astronomy, to which a course in electricity and magnetism was added in <a href="articles/1831.html">1831</a>. Natural <a href="articles/Philosophy.html">Philosophy</a> was taught by <a href="articles/Caswell, Alexis.html">Alexis Caswell</a> from <a href="articles/1828.html">1828</a> to <a href="articles/1850.html">1850</a>, by William Augustus Norton in <a href="articles/1850.html">1850</a> and <a href="articles/1851.html">1851</a>, by Henry Day from <a href="articles/1851.html">1851</a> to <a href="articles/1854.html">1854</a>, again by Caswell from <a href="articles/1855.html">1855</a> to <a href="articles/1864.html">1864</a>. <a href="articles/Greene, Samuel Stillman.html">Samuel Stillman Greene</a> was professor of natural philosophy and astronomy from <a href="articles/1864.html">1864</a> to <a href="articles/1883.html">1883</a>.<p>In <a href="articles/1869.html">1869</a> Rowland Gibson Hazard and his son Rowland Hazard donated $40,000, for a professorship which would benefit the university and concurred in the recommendation of <a href="articles/President.html">President</a> Caswell that the funds be used for the Hazard Professorship of Physics, to which <a href="articles/Blake, Eli Whitney.html">Eli Whitney Blake</a> was appointed. Physics became a very popular study with the arrival in <a href="articles/1870.html">1870</a> of both the well-liked Professor Blake and a Holtz Electrical Machine, from which, in a darkened room, the students observed with wonder the power of electricity. Two members of Blake’s first class, juniors John J. Holbrook <a href="articles/1872.html">1872</a> and Edwin A. Herring <a href="articles/1872.html">1872</a> were inspired by his lectures to install a telegraphic line between their rooms at opposite ends of <a href="articles/University Hall.html">University Hall</a>. Blake was hampered by the lack of facilities, but finally reported in <a href="articles/1877.html">1877</a>, “The Physical laboratory was thrown open to students this year.” Thirteen students applied for the laboratory course, but only ten could be accommodated in two divisions. Blake regretted that during the first year so much time had to be devoted by these students to construction of apparatus, but observed that “the tangible results of their term’s work remain as valuable additions to our means of instruction.” In <a href="articles/1887.html">1887</a>-88 Arnold Green added to the physical apparatus his gift of a barometer, solar radiometer, and hygrometer which had been used by Professor <a href="articles/Caswell, Alexis.html">Alexis Caswell</a> <a href="articles/1822.html">1822</a> in his meteorological observations. In <a href="articles/1891.html">1891</a> <a href="articles/Wilson Hall.html">Wilson Hall</a> was opened for the use of the Physics Department. Its lecture room was used in <a href="articles/1891.html">1891</a>-92 for two <a href="articles/University Extension.html">University Extension</a> courses, one in mechanics and the other in electricity, given by William D. Mount. The first Ph.D. degree in the Physics Department was awarded to Albert DeForest Palmer <a href="articles/1891.html">1891</a> in <a href="articles/1895.html">1895</a>. The next year <a href="articles/Randall, Otis E..html">Otis E. Randall</a> earned a doctorate in mechanics.</p><p><a href="articles/Barus, Carl.html">Carl Barus</a> was named to the Hazard professorship in <a href="articles/1895.html">1895</a>. Palmer remained at Brown and taught in the department until <a href="articles/1934.html">1934</a>, the last two years as associate professor on the Hazard Foundation. <a href="articles/Miller, Carl W..html">Carl W. Miller</a> came in <a href="articles/1924.html">1924</a> and taught until <a href="articles/1955.html">1955</a>. The Physics Department was reorganized in <a href="articles/1926.html">1926</a>, and Frederick George Keyes, head of the Department of <a href="articles/Chemistry.html">Chemistry</a> at M.I.T., was appointed acting head of the department. <a href="articles/Farnsworth, Harrison E..html">Harrison E. Farnsworth</a> joined the department in <a href="articles/1926.html">1926</a> and taught until <a href="articles/1970.html">1970</a>. R. Bruce Lindsay <a href="articles/1920.html">1920</a>, who returned to teach in <a href="articles/1930.html">1930</a>, became chairman of the department in <a href="articles/1934.html">1934</a> and Hazard professor in <a href="articles/1936.html">1936</a>. He brought with him an interest in acoustics, and that field dominated the department for forty years, during which there was a close association with the Acoustical Society of America. Three Brown physics professors served as president of the Society, Lindsay in <a href="articles/1957.html">1957</a>, Robert W. Morse, who came to Brown in <a href="articles/1946.html">1946</a>, in <a href="articles/1966.html">1966</a>, and Robert T. Beyer, who came to Brown in <a href="articles/1950.html">1950</a>, in <a href="articles/1968.html">1968</a>. Lindsay and Beyer were both awarded the Gold Medal of the Society, and Arthur O. Williams, who joined the department in <a href="articles/1950.html">1950</a>, received its Pioneers Medal for work in Underwater Sound. The acoustics work of the department was primarily in underwater sound and in physical acoustics, especially nonlinear acoustics, a field in which Peter J. Westervelt, who joined the department in <a href="articles/1951.html">1951</a>, pioneered.</p><p>Lindsay became <a href="articles/Dean.html">Dean</a> of the <a href="articles/Graduate School.html">Graduate School</a> in <a href="articles/1954.html">1954</a>, and Williams succeeded him as chairman of the department. Under Williams’ direction the department broadened extensively. Professor Russell A. Peck, who had joined the department in <a href="articles/1953.html">1953</a>, carried out research in experimental nuclear physics. With the help of research and technical assistants, he built a 200,000 volt “atom smasher” from scratch (including some war surplus material) in a project supported by the University and the Atomic Energy Commission. The equipment was located in two small buildings (since torn down) at the end of Butler Avenue near the Seekonk River. In the Laboratory of Surface Physics, first located in Barus Hall( the former <a href="articles/President.html">President</a>’s House), then in the old Castle, and, finally, in the new <a href="articles/Barus and Holley Building.html">Barus and Holley Building</a>, Professor <a href="articles/Farnsworth, Harrison E..html">Harrison E. Farnsworth</a> developed apparatus for the atomic cleaning of solid surfaces within a vacuum and work in low-energy electron diffraction. In <a href="articles/1957.html">1957</a> Williams was able to bring in Leon Cooper in solid state theory. Cooper was awarded the Nobel Prize in <a href="articles/1972.html">1972</a> (with Bardeen and superconductivity. Cooper set up a new research program at Brown in neural networks, and was later named Thomas J. Watson Sr. Professor of Science. Williams was named the fourth Hazard professor in <a href="articles/1975.html">1975</a>, and was followed by Beyer as the fifth in <a href="articles/1984.html">1984</a>.</p><p>Philip J. Bray, who had joined the department and begun work in applications of nuclear magnetic resonance to the study of the atomic structure of glass and crystalline materials, became chair of the department in <a href="articles/1963.html">1963</a> and sixth Hazard professor in <a href="articles/1985.html">1985</a>. Under Williams, Morse, and Bray the department added strong research groups in high-energy physics, including Robert Lanou, Anatole Shapiro, and Mildred Widgoff (the first woman professor in the department) as experimentalists, and David Feldman in theory. A theoretical side to the nuclear physics program was added, as well as a new theoretical group in astrophysics. The solid state group was strengthened by the addition of Charles Elbaum and Manuel Cardona, and the theoretical side by John J. Quinn and Anthony Houghton.</p><p>In the late 1960s money was received from Thomas J. Watson Jr. to develop further the program in solid state physics, but the the national decline of support in physics, the department shrank, and the astrophysics group was eliminated. The department did bring in Leon Kadanoff and Walter Massey in theoretical solid state and Phillip J. Stiles in experimental solid state. Stiles served as chairman of the department from <a href="articles/1974.html">1974</a> to <a href="articles/1980.html">1980</a>, and was succeeded by Charles Elbaum who was named Hazard professor in <a href="articles/1991.html">1991</a>. Robert Lanou followed as chairman in <a href="articles/1986.html">1986</a>, and Anthony Houghton in <a href="articles/1992.html">1992</a>.</p>
