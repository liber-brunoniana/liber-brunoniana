Hastings <a href="articles/1876.html">1876</a>, who had not planned to go to college at all, but had been persuaded by his principal at Suffield Academy, who was E. Benjamin Andrews <a href="articles/1870.html">1870</a>, later president of Brown. William Hastings graduated in <a href="articles/1903.html">1903</a>, and immediately began what was to be his life-long teaching career at Brown, being appointed assistant in <a href="articles/English.html">English</a> in <a href="articles/1903.html">1903</a>, instructor in <a href="articles/1907.html">1907</a>, assistant professor in <a href="articles/1912.html">1912</a>, associate professor in <a href="articles/1923.html">1923</a>, professor in <a href="articles/1935.html">1935</a>, and chairman of the Department of <a href="articles/English.html">English</a> from <a href="articles/1937.html">1937</a> to <a href="articles/1949.html">1949</a>. He earned a master of arts degree at Brown in <a href="articles/1905.html">1905</a> and a second master of arts degree at Harvard in <a href="articles/1907.html">1907</a>. His two years of study at Harvard were the only time that he was away from Brown in the 53 years from his arrival as a student in <a href="articles/1899.html">1899</a> until his retirement in <a href="articles/1952.html">1952</a>. His two greatest interests were Shakespeare (he spelled it “Shakspere") and <a href="articles/Phi Beta Kappa.html">Phi Beta Kappa</a>. Elected to <a href="articles/Phi Beta Kappa.html">Phi Beta Kappa</a> in <a href="articles/1902.html">1902</a>, he was secretary of Rhode Island Alpha from <a href="articles/1920.html">1920</a> to <a href="articles/1951.html">1951</a>, vice-president from <a href="articles/1951.html">1951</a> to <a href="articles/1953.html">1953</a>, president from <a href="articles/1953.html">1953</a> to <a href="articles/1955.html">1955</a>, and chapter historian until his death.

He was Secretary of the <a href="articles/Faculty.html">Faculty</a> for twelve years. In <a href="articles/1948.html">1948</a> he attracted attention by being the faculty member who was willing to introduce presidential candidate Henry Wallace when he came to speak on the campus. The purity of the <a href="articles/English.html">English</a> language was important to Hastings and the tendency toward the use of poor <a href="articles/English.html">English</a> disturbed him. He wrote, “No one acquires the command of good <a href="articles/English.html">English</a> without effort, but a person of strong intelligence, character and personality has a sizeable advantage of those less fortunately endowed.” His wife, Hester Mercer Hastings ’03 was housemother at the <a href="articles/Slater Memorial Homestead.html">Slater Memorial Homestead</a>. His two daughters followed academic careers, Hester Hastings ’31 as professor of modern languages at Randolph-Macon Women’s College and Elizabeth Thomson Hastings ’34 as professor of <a href="articles/English.html">English</a> and dean at Case Western Reserve University. Hastings died in Providence on December 18, <a href="articles/1969.html">1969</a>.</p>
