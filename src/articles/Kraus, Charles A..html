<p>Charles August Kraus (<a href="articles/1875.html">1875</a>-<a href="articles/1967.html">1967</a>), professor of chemistry, was born in Knightsville, Indiana, on August 15, <a href="articles/1875.html">1875</a>. His father took the family to Kansas, where he had staked out a homestead and built a sod house. Some of his early schooling took place in his home, and he had an interest in scientific experiments from an early age. In <a href="articles/1893.html">1893</a> he went to the University of Kansas, where he studied electrical engineering and took his only formal chemistry course in his freshman year. He did, however, visit lectures given by chemistry professor Edward C. Franklin, with whom he became friends. He graduated from the University of Kansas in <a href="articles/1898.html">1898</a>, a year late in graduating because of a course he had declined to take. In his final year he and Franklin began to collaborate on their work on solutions in liquid ammonia. He did work in physics at John Hopkins in <a href="articles/1899.html">1899</a>-<a href="articles/1900.html">1900</a> and at the University of Kansas in <a href="articles/1900.html">1900</a>-01, and became instructor in physics at the University of California in <a href="articles/1901.html">1901</a>, remaining until <a href="articles/1904.html">1904</a>. From <a href="articles/1904.html">1904</a> to <a href="articles/1908.html">1908</a> he was a research assistant in physical chemistry at M.I.T., where he received his Ph.D. degree in <a href="articles/1908.html">1908</a>, after which he was a research associate until <a href="articles/1912.html">1912</a>, and associate professor of physical chemical research from <a href="articles/1912.html">1912</a> to <a href="articles/1914.html">1914</a>. He became professor of chemistry and director of the chemical laboratory at Clark University in <a href="articles/1914.html">1914</a>.</p><p>During the World War he directed research at Clark for the Chemical Warfare Service. In <a href="articles/1923.html">1923</a>-24 he was a lecturer at Brown and the following year became professor of chemistry and director of the chemical laboratories. Kraus made an important contribution to the development of the ultra-violet lamp with his method of making vacuum-tight seals between ordinary glass and fused quartz. He was better known for his researches which led to the development of “pyrex” and the production of ethyl gasoline. With his graduate students he did considerable research on liquid ammonia solutions. During <a href="articles/World War II.html">World War II</a> he traveled more than 50,000 miles in his work as consultant to the Manhattan project which developed the atomic bomb. He published more than 225 research papers on such subjects as liquid ammonia, non-aqueous solutions, electrolytic solutions, metals and their solutions, metallo-organic compounds, and conduction in glasses. He was a consulting chemist for the Chemical Warfare Service, U.S.A. and the U.S. Bureau of Mines and Fixed Nitrogen Laboratory. He was awarded the William H. Nichols Medal of the New York section of the American Chemical Society in <a href="articles/1924.html">1924</a>, the Theodore William Richards Medal of the Chicago section in <a href="articles/1935.html">1935</a> and the Northeastern section in <a href="articles/1936.html">1936</a>, the Willard Gibbs Medal of the Chicago section in <a href="articles/1935.html">1935</a>, the Franklin Medal in <a href="articles/1938.html">1938</a> and the Priestly Medal in <a href="articles/1950.html">1950</a>. In <a href="articles/1948.html">1948</a> he was awarded the Navy Distinguished Public Service Award, the highest honor which the Navy can confer upon a civilian. A portrait of Kraus by William Dacey was dedicated in <a href="articles/1950.html">1950</a> and hangs in the auditorium of the <a href="articles/Metcalf Research Laboratory.html">Metcalf Research Laboratory</a>. While sitting for the portrait, Kraus ensured the future welfare of the painting by advising the artist about the special varnishes and the aluminum backing which protect it from the chemical fumes to which it might be exposed.</p><p>His retirement in <a href="articles/1946.html">1946</a> made very little difference in his life style, on which he commented, “you do your work, but you don’t get paid for it.” Professor <a href="articles/Clapp, Leallyn B..html">Leallyn Clapp</a> reminisced about Kraus, “When he celebrated his nintieth birthday, he stopped by the office and everyone sat around with him and tried to reminisce. Charlie wouldn’t have any part of that. At age ninety, he was sitting there telling us all about a new chemical problem he had – he called it H-90 – a problem he was planning to tackle in the laboratory.” His last research paper was published in <a href="articles/1967.html">1967</a>. Kraus died on June 27, <a href="articles/1967.html">1967</a> in East Providence at the age of 91.</p>
