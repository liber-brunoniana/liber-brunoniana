<p>Aldrich-Dexter Field, consisting of thirty-nine acres within the stone wall along Hope Street, Stimson Avenue, Angell Street, Arlington Avenue, and Lloyd Avenue, was purchased in <a href="articles/1957.html">1957</a> as an athletic facility for the University. In <a href="articles/1824.html">1824</a>, the property, known at the time as the Neck Farm, was left to the city of Providence under the will of Ebenezer Knight Dexter as a poor farm for indigent freemen. The wall around the farm was built in <a href="articles/1835.html">1835</a>. The Commissioners of the Dexter Donation reported in <a href="articles/1840.html">1840</a>, “The whole length of the wall is six thousand two hundred and twenty and one-half feet, and contains seven thousand eight hundred and forty cords of stone. It was eight years in being built, and cost twelve thousand six hundred and ninety-nine dollars and eighty-one cents paid for out of the city treasury.” For years the Dexter Asylum served its purpose as a poor farm, sometimes housing 125 persons. At the time of its sale to Brown, there were only eight residents. In <a href="articles/1947.html">1947</a> the city petitioned the Superior Court for permission to sell the land and use the proceeds in other ways “to ameliorate the conditions of the poor” as Dexter’s will intended. After lengthy proceedings the sale of the land by sealed bids on September 26, <a href="articles/1957.html">1957</a> was authorized. Brown’s offer of $1,000,777 was highest by a quarter of a million dollars. <a href="articles/President.html">President</a> Keeney explained, “We are aware that many will regard the price paid by us as large, but we wished to pay a price which will give a clear indication of our appreciation of our long and pleasant relations with the City of Providence. We have made an excellent investment for the present and one whose worth will become even more clearly apparent in the future.” The money for the purchase came from unrestricted funds that were available before the start of the University’s $30,000,000 bicentennial development program, which was not affected. Keeney, elated by the purchase, instructed that the bell on <a href="articles/University Hall.html">University Hall</a> be rung in celebration right after chapel. Then he went fishing. Playing fields for sports other than football were laid out on Aldrich-Dexter Field, and through the years buildings for athletic purposes have been added; <a href="articles/Meehan Auditorium.html">Meehan Auditorium</a>, the hockey rink, in <a href="articles/1961.html">1961</a>; Smith Swim Center in <a href="articles/1972.html">1972</a>; <a href="articles/Olney-Margolies Athletic Center.html">Olney-Margolies Athletic Center</a> in <a href="articles/1981.html">1981</a>; and <a href="articles/Pizzitola Sports Center.html">Pizzitola Sports Center</a> in <a href="articles/1989.html">1989</a>.
