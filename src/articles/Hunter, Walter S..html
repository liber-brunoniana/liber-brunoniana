In <a href="articles/1901.html">1901</a>, after the death of his mother, he and his brother were taken by their father to live on his grandfather’s farm in Saginaw, Texas, where Walter attended a two-room school until <a href="articles/1905.html">1905</a>, when he was admitted to the Preparatory School of the Polytechnic College in Fort Worth. It was there that he read William James, and decided to become a psychologist. After two years at the Polytechnic College, he transferred to the University of Texas, where he took all the available psychology courses, earned $15 a month as an assistant to Dr. C. S. Yoakum in his final year, and conducted a study using a homemade cage in the backyard of his rooming house, which was later published as “Some labyrinth habits of the domestic pigeon.” On graduation from the University of Texas in <a href="articles/1910.html">1910</a>, he was awarded a scholarship for study at the University of Chicago. His dissertation for his doctorate in <a href="articles/1912.html">1912</a> was <i>Delayed Reaction in Animals and Children.</i></p><p>Hunter became an instructor at the University of Texas in <a href="articles/1912.html">1912</a>, adjunct professor at the University of Kansas in <a href="articles/1916.html">1916</a>, and the first G. Stanley Hall Professor of Genetic <a href="articles/Psychology.html">Psychology</a> at Clark University in <a href="articles/1925.html">1925</a>. In the First World War he left Kansas for sixteen months to be chief psychological examiner in three Army camps. At Clark he was able to teach graduate students and devote time to research. His students worked on the sensory control of the maze habit in rats, and Hunter himself in his nine years at Clark published 21 experimental papers, five theoretical studies, four chapters in books, a textbook, <i>Human Behavior,</i> and served on committees of the American Psychological Association and the National Research Council. In <a href="articles/1936.html">1936</a> he came to Brown to replace <a href="articles/Carmichael, Leonard.html">Leonard Carmichael</a>. He stayed for the rest of his life. Also in <a href="articles/1936.html">1936</a> Hunter was appointed Chairman of the Division of <a href="articles/Anthropology.html">Anthropology</a> and <a href="articles/Psychology.html">Psychology</a> of the National Research Council.

He resigned the chairmanship of the <a href="articles/Psychology.html">Psychology</a> Department on his 65th birthday in March <a href="articles/1954.html">1954</a>. A few months later after returning from a trip he suffered a sudden coronary occlusion and died in Providence on August 3, <a href="articles/1954.html">1954</a>.
