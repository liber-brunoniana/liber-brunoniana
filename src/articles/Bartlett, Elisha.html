He was educated in Smithfield, Uxbridge, and a Friends school in New York. He studied medicine with Dr. Willard of Uxbridge, Dr. Green and Dr. Heywood of Worcester, and Dr. <a href="articles/Wheaton, Levi.html">Levi Wheaton</a> of Providence. He earned an M.D. degree at Brown’s medical school in <a href="articles/1826.html">1826</a>. He traveled in Europe for a year and settled in Lowell, Massachusetts, where he delivered lectures on contagious diseases, sanitation, hygiene, and physiology. At the age of 32 he was elected the first mayor of Lowell, and in <a href="articles/1841.html">1841</a> he was elected to the Massachusetts State legislature. He taught in nine schools, his appointments being professor of pathological anatomy and materia medica at the Berkshire Medical Institute in Pittsfield, Massachusetts in <a href="articles/1832.html">1832</a>, professor at Dartmouth in <a href="articles/1839.html">1839</a>, professor of the theory and practice of medicine at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky in <a href="articles/1841.html">1841</a> and at the University of Maryland in <a href="articles/1844.html">1844</a>, professor of materia medica and obstetrics at Vermont Medical College in <a href="articles/1844.html">1844</a> (he taught a course for thirteen weeks each year until <a href="articles/1854.html">1854</a>), and professor of the theory and practice of medicine at the University of Louisville in March <a href="articles/1849.html">1849</a> for one session only, after which he went to the University of New York.

His friend Elisha Huntington said in a sketch of Bartlett’s life, “Never was the professor’s chair more gracefuly filled than by Dr. Bartlett.” His other career was as a medical writer with the <i>Monthly Journal of Medical Literature and American Student’s Gazette</i> (of which there were only three issues), and <i>Medical Magazine</i> from <a href="articles/1832.html">1832</a> to <a href="articles/1835.html">1835</a>.

In <a href="articles/1844.html">1844</a> he wrote <i>An Essay on the <a href="articles/Philosophy.html">Philosophy</a> of Medicine.</i> But his main work was that on fevers, published in <a href="articles/1842.html">1842</a> with three subsequent editions, one of the most notable medical works known as “Bartlett on Fevers.” When illness which was to result in paralysis struck Bartlett in <a href="articles/1854.html">1854</a>, he passed his time writing a little volume entitled <i>Simple Settings in Verse, for Six Portraits and Pictures from Mr. Dickens’s Gallery,</i> which he sent as a farewell gift to his friends before his death on July 19, <a href="articles/1855.html">1855</a>.</p>
