He received his master’s degree in <a href="articles/1947.html">1947</a> and his Ph.D. in <a href="articles/1953.html">1953</a>, both from Princeton.

The memorial minute presented to the <a href="articles/Faculty.html">Faculty</a> read in part:</p><blockquote>“Gordon was not a man of fashions, and he did not pretend to like change for the sake of change. As a <a href="articles/Dean.html">Dean</a> he was skeptical of much that was introduced as innovation into this university to which he was so deeply committed; but as in all spheres of his life he was not only forthright in his questioning and criticisms, he was willing to state publicly when he belived himself to have been in error or when he revised an opinion because experience had persuaded him. He was generous and supportive to newcomers to the deanery ... providing each in turn with the fruits of his long knowledge of the personalities and procedures of all parts of the University.</blockquote>
