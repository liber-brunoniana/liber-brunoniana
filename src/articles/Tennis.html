<p>Tennis at Brown began in the early 1880s. The <a href="articles/1881.html">1881</a> <i><a href="articles/Liber Brunensis.html">Liber Brunensis</a></i> notes the existence of the Alpha Delta Phi, Chi Phi, and Psi Upsilon tennis clubs. In the next two years there were several additional clubs, and on April 14, <a href="articles/1883.html">1883</a>, the Brown University Lawn Tennis Association was formed. The officers of the association were Abram Barker <a href="articles/1883.html">1883</a>, H. B. Gardner <a href="articles/1884.html">1884</a>, and J. B. Diman <a href="articles/1885.html">1885</a>. Two tournaments, spring and fall, were planned. Two weeks later the executive committee reported that two courts were ready for use. The next year there were 61 members of the association, four of whom represented Brown at an intercollegiate tournament. The <a href="articles/1890.html">1890</a> <i><a href="articles/Liber Brunensis.html">Liber Brunensis</a></i> reported, “Tennis has developed wonderfully. Four years ago there were but four courts on the college grounds, and those were hardly worth the name. Now the whole middle campus is covered with them, and it is no unusual thing to see twenty or thirty men playing at once, not to mention those who belong to clubs in the city.” Fred Hovey <a href="articles/1890.html">1890</a>, a future national champion who won the U.S. Doubles in <a href="articles/1893.html">1893</a> and <a href="articles/1894.html">1894</a> and the U.S. Singles in <a href="articles/1895.html">1895</a>, won the college championship in <a href="articles/1887.html">1887</a> and successfully defended it against William R. Weeden <a href="articles/1891.html">1891</a>, the winner of the <a href="articles/1888.html">1888</a> tournament. Hovey was second in the singles at the intercollegiate tournament in New Haven in <a href="articles/1889.html">1889</a>. The next two years he was first, but by that time he was playing for Harvard, where he was a law school student. J. D. E. Jones <a href="articles/1893.html">1893</a> represented Brown at the intercollegiates for two years, but, like Hovey, his tennis career was at its best after college, when he won five Rhode Island state singles and five doubles titles and reached the semi-finals at the national tournament at the Newport Casino in <a href="articles/1906.html">1906</a>. In the intercollegiate tournament in <a href="articles/1893.html">1893</a> Brown took firsts in both the singles and doubles, the former won by Malcolm Chace <a href="articles/1896.html">1896</a>, and the latter by Chace and Clarence Budlong <a href="articles/1897.html">1897</a>, a freshman who had won the interscholastic singles of the United States while he was in high school. The next year Budlong was second in the intercollegiate singles, losing to Chace, who had transferred to Yale.</p><p>At a tournament of the newly organized New England Tennis Association in <a href="articles/1900.html">1900</a> at Longwood, Massachusetts, E. T. Gross ’01 won the singles championship, and teamed with Frank Gooding ’01 to win the doubles. The Tennis Association continued to hold an annual fall tournament for the college. There was a dual meet with M.I.T. in <a href="articles/1911.html">1911</a>, and in May <a href="articles/1912.html">1912</a> a schedule of five games with Union, Williams, Harvard, Trinity, and Minnesota.</p><p>Tennis was revived in <a href="articles/1920.html">1920</a> after a lapse of several years and became a recognized sport in <a href="articles/1922.html">1922</a>. In <a href="articles/1925.html">1925</a>-26 eleven new clay courts were added, and Brown won six of eight dual meets. The teams of <a href="articles/1927.html">1927</a> and <a href="articles/1928.html">1928</a> were undefeated, and teams of the 1930s were generally successful. J. D. E. Jones coached at the beginning of the 1950s. <a href="articles/Football.html">Football</a> coach Charles A. “Rip” Engle took over from <a href="articles/1942.html">1942</a> to <a href="articles/1944.html">1944</a>.

John Houk ’55 compiled the best record at Brown of 35-5 for three varsity seasons in the number one position. There were more winning seasons, nine of the eleven seasons before Brown’s entry into the <a href="articles/Ivy League.html">Ivy League</a> in <a href="articles/1961.html">1961</a>. The stiff Ivy competition was too much. It was <a href="articles/1964.html">1964</a> before the Brown team defeated its first Ivy opponent, Dartmouth with a 5-4 score. Palmer coached until <a href="articles/1965.html">1965</a>.

His ten-year record is 95-65 overall and 44-44 in the Eastern Intercollegiate Tennis Association. In <a href="articles/1987.html">1987</a> Tim Donovan ’89 became the first Brown player to win the New England championship twice.</p><h2>Women’s Tennis</h2><p>A women’s tennis association was formed in <a href="articles/1900.html">1900</a> as an alternative to indoor gymnasium classes.
