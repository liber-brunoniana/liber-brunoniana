<p>History had a very small representation in the early curriculum of the college. The Laws of <a href="articles/1783.html">1783</a> do mention “Bolingbroke on History” as one of the books to be studied in the senior year. <a href="articles/Gammell, William.html">William Gammell</a>, professor of rhetoric, instructed the junior class in modern history in the third term of <a href="articles/1843.html">1843</a>-44, in accordance with a vote of the <a href="articles/Corporation.html">Corporation</a> in September <a href="articles/1843.html">1843</a>, using as a textbook Smythe’s <i>Lectures on Modern History,</i> which he reported to be satisfactory for the course, although “requiring of the student a vast amount of collateral reading of history.” In <a href="articles/1845.html">1845</a>-46 he added recitations in history for the senior class, and in the second term of <a href="articles/1847.html">1847</a>-48 “read lectures on American history to the senior class.” In the second term of <a href="articles/1850.html">1850</a>-51 there was a newly created chair of history and political economy held by Gammell. <a href="articles/Angell, James Burrill.html">James Burrill Angell</a> <a href="articles/1849.html">1849</a> commented on Gammell’s teaching, “His course in history was fuller than that at any other college except Harvard. It was chiefly devoted to <a href="articles/English.html">English</a> constitutional history, although some time was given to American constitutional history. It called for solid and fruitful work.” Gammell, retiring in <a href="articles/1864.html">1864</a>, was succeeded by a former pupil, <a href="articles/Diman, Jeremiah Lewis.html">Jeremiah Lewis Diman</a>. <a href="articles/Sears, Barnas.html">Barnas Sears</a> taught history at the end of the <a href="articles/1863.html">1863</a>-64 academic year. Diman’s course consisted of a course of two terms in the senior year, the first extending from the fall of the Western Empire to the close of the Mediaeval Period, the second from the Renaissance to the end of the American Colonial Period, ending with a study of the United States Constitution. In <a href="articles/1871.html">1871</a> Diman’s annual report mentioned the increased attention being given to the history of Political Opinion, and in <a href="articles/1872.html">1872</a> he announced that the class was responding to a new method of reading widely instead of being confined to a single text and of writing every four weeks an “elaborate historical essay.” In <a href="articles/1877.html">1877</a>-78 Diman added an elective course for seniors in the history of architecture. Diman died suddenly at the beginning of the second term of <a href="articles/1880.html">1880</a>-81. The continuation of his history course presented a problem, but, at the request of the senior class, Professor Diman’s lectures from previous years were read to them. The reading was performed by one of Diman’s former students, Professor <a href="articles/Williams, Alonzo.html">Alonzo Williams</a>. <a href="articles/Greene, Samuel Stillman.html">Samuel Stillman Greene</a> took over the instruction in political economy. For the next two years William C. Russell was acting professor of history and political economy, until <a href="articles/Andrews, Elisha Benjamin.html">Elisha Benjamin Andrews</a> was appointed to the professorship in <a href="articles/1882.html">1882</a>.

In <a href="articles/1889.html">1889</a>-90 the Brown University Historical and Economic Association gave two series of public lectures in <a href="articles/Manning Hall.html">Manning Hall</a>, presenting such speakers as Woodrow Wilson, <a href="articles/Wayland, Francis.html">Francis Wayland</a> <a href="articles/1846.html">1846</a>, and Edward Everett Hale. In <a href="articles/1891.html">1891</a>-92 Jameson introduced a new course of practical exercises in American history, in which students did independent work on selected topics, using original materials in local libraries. At about the same time the Seminary of History, Political Economy, and <a href="articles/Political Science.html">Political Science</a>, a voluntary association of teachers, graduate students, and advanced undergraduates met regularly in the library for discussion. Wilfred Harold Munro <a href="articles/1870.html">1870</a> was associate professor of history from <a href="articles/1891.html">1891</a> to <a href="articles/1899.html">1899</a> and professor of European history from <a href="articles/1899.html">1899</a> to <a href="articles/1911.html">1911</a>. <a href="articles/Collier, Theodore.html">Theodore Collier</a> was associate professor of European history from <a href="articles/1911.html">1911</a> to <a href="articles/1917.html">1917</a>, professor from <a href="articles/1917.html">1917</a> to <a href="articles/1923.html">1923</a>, and professor of history and international relations after <a href="articles/1923.html">1923</a>.
