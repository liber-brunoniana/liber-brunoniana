<p>The Orwig <a href="./Music.html">Music</a> Center occupies a building at 1 Young Orchard Avenue, which was built about <a href="./1850.html">1850</a> for Byron Sprague, son of manufacturer Amasa Sprague. After the collapse of the Sprague business in <a href="./1873.html">1873</a>, the house passed into other hands and was eventually purchased by I. Gifford Ladd. At this time the stone-trimmed brick Italianate mansion was remodeled by architects Carrère and Hastings and given a French Renaissance exterior. Later the building was the Hope Hospital, was sold to <a href="./Bryant College.html">Bryant College</a> and named South Hall, and was acquired by Brown in <a href="./1969.html">1969</a> with the purchase of the <a href="./Bryant College.html">Bryant College</a> campus. The music complex was named for Benton B. Orwig ’20 in consideration of a donation by his widow, Virginia Baldwin Orwig.
