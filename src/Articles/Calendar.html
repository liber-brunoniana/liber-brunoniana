In <a href="./1853.html">1853</a> the date of <a href="./Commencement.html">Commencement</a> was changed back to September by popular demand, but the two term calendar remained the same. After <a href="./Commencement.html">Commencement</a> was moved to the last Wednesday in June in <a href="./1870.html">1870</a>, the calendar was changed in <a href="./1871.html">1871</a> so that the first semester ended in mid-January and the second began on February 9 after a three week recess, ending just before <a href="./Commencement.html">Commencement</a>.
