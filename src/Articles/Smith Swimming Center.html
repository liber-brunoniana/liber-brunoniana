<p>The Smith <a href="./Swimming.html">Swimming</a> Center was opened in <a href="./1973.html">1973</a>, replacing the 70 year old Colgate Hoyt pool. The architect of the building was Daniel Tully, the builder, Paul Hodess, and the designer, George R. Whitten. Two million one-inch tiles cover the floor and sides of the pool, which is 50-meters long with a 25-yard course at one end. The building with prefabricated sides and a roof with circus-tent peaks was erected in seven weeks, a very short time, preceded by a very long time since <a href="./1943.html">1943</a>, when coach Joe Watmough was encouraged to come to Brown with the idea that a new swimming pool was soon to be built. For want of a name, the new pool was called “ldquo;the natatorium,”rdquo; until March 24, <a href="./1976.html">1976</a>, when the pool was dedicated and named for H. Stanton Smith ’21, a benefactor active in alumni affairs and his wife, Marjorie Brown Smith, who had been acting director of physical education at <a href="./Pembroke College.html">Pembroke College</a>.</p>
