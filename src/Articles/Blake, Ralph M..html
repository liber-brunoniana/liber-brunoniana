Ducasse described Blake in a memorial minute:</p><blockquote>“His knowledge of the history of philosophy, and especially of medieval philosophy, was extraordinarily extensive, minute, accurate, and independent. But he was interested also and highly competent in the several main fields of systematic philosophy.... Many remarked on his unusual capacity to project himself for the time being into the points of view of the philosophers whose doctrines he expounded. Even when he personally disagreed with them, no advocate could have been more scrupulously faithful to their thought than he was, or have presented it more sympathetically and plausibly.” </blockquote>
