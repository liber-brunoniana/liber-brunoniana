<p>The Sophomore Masque began in <a href="./1907.html">1907</a>. The Women’s College Class of <a href="./1909.html">1909</a> decided that year not to continue the “initiation ceremonies,” which the sophomores had been accustomed to inflict upon the freshmen. Upperclass students felt that a time-honored tradition was being broken, so the sophomores decided to create a new custom which would create class spirit and would be repeated by later classes. The Class of <a href="./1909.html">1909</a> decided to initiate the tradition of a “Class Flower.” Class colors were already a fixture, with yellow, green, pink, and blue being adopted in rotation by each entering class by inheritance from the class just graduated. Since the color of the Class of <a href="./1909.html">1909</a> was pink, the class flower selected was the rose, chosen in secret to be presented at a masque written by the sophomores, which told the story of a princess, who had been put to sleep by a witch and could be awakened only by one flower. After a character, “Spring,” called for violets, daffodils, and lilies to no avail, “Summer” brought forth one pink rose, and the princess awoke. Only women were invited – members of the Rhode Island Society for Collegiate <a href="./Education.html">Education</a> of Women, faculty wives, and women students. Members of the Class of <a href="./1909.html">1909</a>, as creators of the custom, received by vote of the Student Government Association in their senior year the privilege of attending any future sophomore masques. The next year a blue forget-me-not saved a prince chained by magic, and succeeding classes presented the chrysanthemum, lily-of-the-valley, pink sweet peas, and Canterbury bell. Class “mascots” also became part of the theme of the sophomore masque. The Class of <a href="./1911.html">1911</a> presented a Japanese doll, and proceeded to include her as “Kiko-No Hana” among the class members in the <a href="./1911.html">1911</a> <i><a href="./Brun Mael.html">Brun Mael</a>.</i> The mascot of the Class of <a href="./1915.html">1915</a> was a professor’s daughter, four-year-old Janet Benedict, who appeared in person. “Winged Victory” was the mascot of the Class of <a href="./1917.html">1917</a>. The Class of <a href="./1918.html">1918</a> introduced the Clintonian lily, which was the class flower as its mascot. Sometimes mascots were presented apart from the masque performance, at a tea or “Mascot Day.” In <a href="./1918.html">1918</a> the masque became part of the <a href="./May Day.html">May Day</a> ceremonies. The mascots became a feature of <a href="./Spring Day.html">Spring Day</a> in <a href="./1922.html">1922</a>. The presentation of the class flower was included in the masque until <a href="./1936.html">1936</a>. The masques usually had mythical themes contrived to include the class flower. The masque of <a href="./1937.html">1937</a> was different, having as its subject the despair of the inhabitants of the world about the evils of civilization, presented five scenes (Politics, Domestic Dilemma, Recreation, Economic, Religion) and a sixth (Vision), which represented “the unclassifiable philosophers in whose minds the barriers between the preceding five phases have never existed,” who are supposed to unite the world. That presentation and several later ones were choreographed by Otto Ashermann and accompanied by an orchestra led by Robert Gray. <a href="./May Day.html">May Day</a> and the masque became features of the Mother-Daughter Weekend in the 1950s and continued to be held until <a href="./1967.html">1967</a>.</p>
