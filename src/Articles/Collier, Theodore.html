Along the way he acquired teaching experience in a number of secondary schools, Pritchett Institute in Missouri, Englewood School for Boys in New Jersey, and the Manual Training High School in Brooklyn. He was at Williams College from <a href="./1905.html">1905</a> to <a href="./1911.html">1911</a> as instructor and later assistant professor of history, and came to Brown in <a href="./1911.html">1911</a> as associate professor.
