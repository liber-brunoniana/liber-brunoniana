He studied at Union Theological Seminary from <a href="articles/1899.html">1899</a> to <a href="articles/1902.html">1902</a> and at the Universities of Berlin and Marburg in <a href="articles/1903.html">1903</a>-04. He earned his Ph.D. degree from Cornell in <a href="articles/1907.html">1907</a>. Along the way he acquired teaching experience in a number of secondary schools, Pritchett Institute in Missouri, Englewood School for Boys in New Jersey, and the Manual Training High School in Brooklyn. He was at Williams College from <a href="articles/1905.html">1905</a> to <a href="articles/1911.html">1911</a> as instructor and later assistant professor of history, and came to Brown in <a href="articles/1911.html">1911</a> as associate professor. He was professor of European history from <a href="articles/1917.html">1917</a> to <a href="articles/1923.html">1923</a>, professor of history and international relations from <a href="articles/1923.html">1923</a> to <a href="articles/1944.html">1944</a>, and head of the Department of <a href="articles/History.html">History</a> from <a href="articles/1917.html">1917</a> to <a href="articles/1939.html">1939</a>.
