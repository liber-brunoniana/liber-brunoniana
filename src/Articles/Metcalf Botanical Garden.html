<p>The Metcalf Botanical Garden, occupying between thirteen and fourteen acres between Morris Avenue and Cypress Street was deeded to Brown in <a href="./1884.html">1884</a> by Mrs. Almira T. Metcalf as a permanent memorial to her husband, Whiting Taft Metcalf, who had planted about half of the hundred trees on the site. The only building on the grounds was a barn, the Metcalf home having burned in <a href="./1875.html">1875</a>. In her letter conveying the land, Mrs. Metcalf noted that it might be used for the erection of an astronomical observatory, for other buildings “to promote the scientific ends of the University,” and for the establishment of a botanical garden in memory of her husband. In accepting the gift, <a href="./President.html">President</a> Robinson hoped that the land might be put to use in connection with the requirements of the land grant which Brown had received. In <a href="./1889.html">1889</a> two and one-half additional acres adjoining the property were added, having been acquired by a mortgage foreclosure, and came to Brown through the efforts of former Chancellor <a href="./Goddard, William Giles.html">William Goddard</a>, who had purchased it either in his own name or as an agent of the University. In the following years the University lost the land grant, erected the observatory elsewhere, and did not have the funds to establish the botanical garden, although advice on its development had been sought from two Harvard professors. Some income was brought in by leasing the land. In <a href="./1897.html">1897</a> an attempt by the heirs to recover the land on the grounds of non-compliance was not allowed by the court, and in <a href="./1908.html">1908</a> Mrs. Metcalf’s daughter, Almira Pierce, unwillingly paid Brown $8,000 which she had held in trust “for the improvement of the ... Botanical Garden,” and took this opportunity to protest the University’s inaction. In <a href="./1900.html">1900</a> the trees had been marked with labels and a fence built for the protection of the new nursery. In <a href="./1903.html">1903</a> the University School obtained permission to use part of the grounds for athletics, and a fence was installed to separate the rented pasture. The <a href="./English.html">English</a> Department used the Garden as background for Shakespearean plays. One such scheduled performance by Ben Greet’s “Everyman” company in June <a href="./1903.html">1903</a> was “rained out” and staged in Infantry Hall. The only truly botanical use of the Garden was a study of the pathology of pine trees conducted by Professor Harlan H. York. Improvements in <a href="./1912.html">1912</a> included a new fence and the planting of hedges around the grounds. During <a href="./World War I.html">World War I</a> about six and one-half acres were set aside for a “<a href="./Faculty.html">Faculty</a> Garden,” where faculty members planted their own vegetables. In <a href="./1917.html">1917</a> the University purchased the Durfee land between Elmgrove and Cole Avenues, and then began negotiations with the heir of the donors of the botanical garden property, with a view to using the combined site for an athletic plant  The result was the removal of the restrictions on the use of the Metcalf Botanical Garden in consideration of the return of approximately one-third of the land to the heir, and the building of the <a href="./Stadium.html">Stadium</a> on the lot.</p>
