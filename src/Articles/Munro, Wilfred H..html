He attended Mowry and Goff’s <a href="./English.html">English</a> and Classical School and graduated from Brown in <a href="./1870.html">1870</a>. He was captain of the Class of <a href="./1870.html">1870</a> baseball team which defeated the New England champion Lowells of Boston, 22 to 19, in a game played on June 17, <a href="./1868.html">1868</a>. In later years the members of the team were accustomed to hold reunions at Professor Munro’s home to reminisce about their triumph. A baseball feat of Munro’s, fondly recounted by his brother, Walter Lee Munro <a href="./1879.html">1879</a> in <i>The Old Back <a href="./Campus.html">Campus</a> at Brown,</i> took place on the ball field on what is now the Middle <a href="./Campus.html">Campus</a>, when Wilfred Munro hit a foul fly ball to right field and broke all eight panes of a window in <a href="./University Hall.html">University Hall</a>. After college, Munro taught at De Veaux College in Niagara Falls, was associate principal of St. Mark’s School in Salt Lake City in <a href="./1871.html">1871</a>, spent some time in Central and South America, was principal of the Academic Institute in Le Roy, New York, from <a href="./1875.html">1875</a> to <a href="./1879.html">1879</a>, and returned to De Veaux College as president from <a href="./1881.html">1881</a> to <a href="./1889.html">1889</a>. He resumed his study of history at Freiburg and Heidelburg in <a href="./1890.html">1890</a> and <a href="./1891.html">1891</a>, and in <a href="./1891.html">1891</a> began his teaching career at Brown as associate professor of history. His title was changed to professor of European history in <a href="./1899.html">1899</a>. His course on European history after <a href="./1815.html">1815</a> was popular with the students, who called him “ldquo;Pop”rdquo; Munro. He was appointed the first director of <a href="./University Extension.html">University Extension</a> in <a href="./1890.html">1890</a>-91, and, as he was traveling in Europe at the time of his appointment, he was able to study methods used in England before he initiated the extension program, which he continued to direct until <a href="./1899.html">1899</a>. He retired from teaching in <a href="./1911.html">1911</a>. He wrote on both European and local history. He was the author of the inscription on the memorial in Plymouth which commemorates the Mayflower passengers who died during the first year in Plymouth. He published <i><a href="./History.html">History</a> of Bristol, Rhode Island</i> in <a href="./1880.html">1880</a>, <i>Picturesque Rhode Island</i> in <a href="./1881.html">1881</a>, and another history of Bristol, <i>Tales of an Old Seaport</i> in <a href="./1917.html">1917</a>. He was editor of <i>The Works of William H. Prescott,</i> and of two editions of <i>Memorial Encyclopedia of the State of Rhode Island.</i> He died on August 9, <a href="./1934.html">1934</a> in Providence. In his obituary notice in the <i>Brown Alumni Monthly</i> it was noted:</p><blockquote>“ldquo;Many alumni will recall with affection his elective course, ‘European <a href="./History.html">History</a> After <a href="./1815.html">1815</a>.’ It was a popular course – a little too popular to suit some of Professor Munro’s colleagues. The lectures frequently failed to have anything to do with the wreck that was Europe after Napoleon went to St. Helena, but they were chatty, wise and informing. Professor Munro had been somewhere and had seen things. He liked to talk about his travels and his observations. He had an easy narrative style, which stirred interest and aroused longings. Anyone who failed in his course shouldn’t have been in college, anyway.”rdquo;</blockquote>
