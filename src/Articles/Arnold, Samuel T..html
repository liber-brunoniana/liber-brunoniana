In <a href="./1929.html">1929</a> he was Acting <a href="./Dean.html">Dean</a> of the University during <a href="./Dean.html">Dean</a> Randall’s leave of absence, with responsibility for the three upper classes of students. In <a href="./1930.html">1930</a> he was given the new title of <a href="./Dean.html">Dean</a> of Undergraduates. In <a href="./1937.html">1937</a> he was named <a href="./Dean.html">Dean</a> of the College, and in <a href="./1946.html">1946</a> the title of <a href="./Dean.html">Dean</a> of the University was revived for him, with a wider meaning as his academic responsibilities now extended to include the <a href="./Graduate School.html">Graduate School</a>, <a href="./Pembroke College.html">Pembroke College</a>, and the <a href="./Veterans College.html">Veterans College</a>. In addition to his administrative duties he retained his connection with the Department of <a href="./Chemistry.html">Chemistry</a> and the scientific world outside the University. It was because of his wide acquaintance with other scientists and the confidence that they had in him that during the Second World War he was on leave of absence, having been enlisted by <a href="./President.html">President</a> Conant of Harvard for a “ldquo;vital job on behalf of the War Department.”rdquo; <a href="./President.html">President</a> Wriston acted as dean in his absence. Arnold was working for an agency with the noncommittal name of Manhattan Engineers District of the Corps of Engineers, the “ldquo;Manhattan project”rdquo; which produced the atomic bomb. It was his job to recruit scientists from industry and education for the project, an undertaking which depended on the confidence which these people had in him, since he could not tell them the reason that the government required their services. His activities outside the University were many – first president of the Association of Naval NROTC Colleges, vice-president of the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators, president of the Eastern Association of Deans and Advisors of Men, to name a few. He served the community on the State Council of Defense and the Governor’s Committee of Educational Television, and was a trustee of the <a href="./Rhode Island School of Design.html">Rhode Island School of Design</a> and Citizens Saving Bank, and a director of the Narragansett Electric Company.

A native kindliness, which was reflected in his gentle face, governed his actions, but not indiscriminately. As an important executive, he had to say ‘no’ frequently, but he said ‘no’ in such a manner that the petitioner thanked him instead of stumping out of his office.”rdquo;</p>
