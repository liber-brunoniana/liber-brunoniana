<p>Spring Weekend began in <a href="articles/1950.html">1950</a>, having evolved from the “All-<a href="articles/Campus.html">Campus</a> Weekend,” which had in <a href="articles/1948.html">1948</a> replaced the longstanding <a href="articles/Junior Week.html">Junior Week</a> and Junior Prom, which had lapsed during <a href="articles/World War II.html">World War II</a>. The <a href="articles/1950.html">1950</a> weekend began on Friday with the inter-fraternity sing and the Hilltoppers Ball with the tapping of the new <a href="articles/Brown Key.html">Brown Key</a> members, which had formerly been a feature of the junior prom. Assorted athletic contests were scheduled during the weekend, and on Saturday a buffet supper on the College Green was followed by dances at <a href="articles/Faunce House.html">Faunce House</a> and the fraternity houses. In the 1960s concerts by celebrities took the place of the dances, and the <a href="articles/Brown Key.html">Brown Key</a> tapping took place during the intermission. Among the Spring Weekend performers were Ella Fitzgerald and Bo Diddley in <a href="articles/1965.html">1965</a> and Janis Joplin, whose concert was crashed by 50 persons with forged tickets, in <a href="articles/1969.html">1969</a>. In <a href="articles/1967.html">1967</a> Peter, Paul and Mary sang, and Martin Luther King, coincidentally in Providence on other business, preached at the Sunday Protestant service in <a href="articles/Sayles Hall.html">Sayles Hall</a>. In <a href="articles/1970.html">1970</a> the entertainment was provided by Jefferson Airplane, Ray Charles, and Judy Collins and the preaching by William Sloane Coffin. Spring Weekend, which extends from Thursday afternoon through Sunday eventually began to include, in addition to a number of different musical events, a continuing supply of food, including an all-you-can-eat ice cream trough on the campus and several charitable fund-raising activities, such as Alpha Delta Phi’s Bizarre Bazaar, and Phi Kappa Psi’s tricycle race. Drinking, always a traditional part of Spring Weekend, prompted the University in <a href="articles/1984.html">1984</a> to provide an added service, off-duty state troopers who offered optional breathalyzer tests as a guide to responsible imbibing.</p>
