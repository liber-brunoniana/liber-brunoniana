He was at that time fourteen years old and had studied under the Reverend Aaron Hutchinson of Grafton, Massachusetts.

In December of that year he left the Newport academy of which he was principal and went to Philadelphia.

He resigned his professorship in the University of Pennsylvania in <a href="./1812.html">1812</a>, attributing his departure to “Arbitrary Resolutions of its Trustees to which they were instigated by the restless and ambitious spirit of a despotical <a href="./Provost.html">Provost</a> John Andrews.” He had numerous other interests, being at various times vice-president of the Pennsylvania society for the gradual abolition of slavery; vice-president of the Philadelphia society for alleviating the miseries of public prisons; chaplain of the Philadelphia militia legion; and a member of the Pennsylvania legislature.
