The plan was to enlist their aid in raising money for a building for the women students. The group of women was organized as the College Fund Committee with Miss Doyle as chairman and launched a campaign to raise $75,000. After collecting enough money to begin building in February <a href="./1896.html">1896</a>, the committee was disbanded and the Rhode Island Society for the Collegiate <a href="./Education.html">Education</a> of Women was established in its place.
