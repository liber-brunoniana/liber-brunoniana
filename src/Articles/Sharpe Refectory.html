<p>Sharpe Refectory was built in <a href="./1950.html">1950</a> at a cost of two million dollars to accommodate 1,640 students in the main dining room and the eighteen (seventeen for the fraternities) private dining rooms around the perimeter, with a cafeteria, the Ivy Room, in the basement for commuters and staff. The refectory was named for Chancellor <a href="./Sharpe, Henry D. 1894.html">Henry D. Sharpe</a> <a href="./1894.html">1894</a>, and opened in January <a href="./1951.html">1951</a>. When it was new, 125 student waiters served all the diners in one session, employing “ldquo;family style”rdquo; service, bringing food to the table for diners to serve themselves. Board at the opening date of the refectory was $215 a semester for 20 meals a week. The students soon changed “ldquo;Refectory”rdquo; to “ldquo;Rat-factory,”rdquo; which was in turn shortened to “ldquo;Ratty,”rdquo; a name in general use today. Later the service was changed to cafeteria style, and in <a href="./1982.html">1982</a> the former private fraternity dining rooms were made available for the use of other groups.</p>
