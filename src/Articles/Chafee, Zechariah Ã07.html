<p>Zechariah Chafee, Jr. (<a href="./1885.html">1885</a>-<a href="./1957.html">1957</a>), University Professor at Harvard University and champion of civil liberties, was born in Providence on December 7, <a href="./1885.html">1885</a>. His father, Zechariah Chafee <a href="./1880.html">1880</a>, was president of Builders Iron Foundry and a long-time trustee and fellow of the University. Zechariah, Jr. graduated from Brown in <a href="./1907.html">1907</a> and worked for a few years in his father’s business before entering Harvard Law School, where he received his LL.B. degree in <a href="./1913.html">1913</a>. After three years with the law firm of Tillinghast and Collins in Providence, he began his teaching career at Harvard in <a href="./1916.html">1916</a> as assistant professor of law, and became full professor in <a href="./1919.html">1919</a>, Langdell Professor of Law in <a href="./1938.html">1938</a>, and University Professor in <a href="./1950.html">1950</a>. On his 70th birthday, speaking of the changes since he began teaching, he said, “Legal knowledge has grown so much that I probably know a smaller percentage of existing law now than I did then.” One bit of law that he did learn is apparent in a letter to Librarian David A. Jonah, written by Chafee in <a href="./1952.html">1952</a> when he presented his college essays to the Archives of the University, which contained this comment: “I blush now to think of the use that I made of some sort of encyclopedia of criticism, which was possessed by the old polygonal library. I fear there is more of this <a href="./English.html">English</a> in these papers than accords with my present views of the Law of Copyright.”</p><p>Described as “somewhat to the left of most of his university colleagues,” Chafee wrote extensively in defense of personal liberty and freedom of the press. In <a href="./1952.html">1952</a> at a Senate subcommittee meeting, Senator Joseph R. McCarthy named Chafee a person “dangerous” to the United States. His publications included <i>Freedom of Speech</i> in <a href="./1920.html">1920</a>, <i>Free Speech in the United States</i> in <a href="./1941.html">1941</a>, and <i>Government and Mass Communications</i> in <a href="./1947.html">1947</a>. His last book was <i>The Blessings of Liberty</i> in <a href="./1956.html">1956</a>. He retired in July <a href="./1956.html">1956</a>, and died in Boston on February 8, <a href="./1957.html">1957</a>. In the Chafee Garden at the rear of the Rockefeller <a href="./Library.html">Library</a> the words on the commemorative plaque are, “Distinguished Undergraduate &amp; Devoted Alumnus - Lover of Good Talk and Good Books - Stimulating Companion &amp; Loyal and Kindly Friend - Noted Scholar and Jurist - Unfaltering Champion of Freedom of Speech - Influential and Beloved Teacher - Courageous Preserver of the Blessings of Liberty.”</p>
