<p>Gardner House at 106 George Street is maintained for the use of visiting dignitaries and invited guests of the University. The arrangement which led to the acquisition of the house was made by George W. Gardner <a href="articles/1894.html">1894</a>, his wife, Jessie Barker Gardner <a href="articles/1896.html">1896</a>, and their friend since college days, Vice-<a href="articles/President.html">President</a> <a href="articles/Mead, Albert D..html">Albert D. Mead</a>. The Gardners owned a home on Orchard Avenue filled with precious antique furniture which they wished to give to Brown. The house on George Street, an elegant three-story brick Federal house built by mason Joseph Haile in <a href="articles/1806.html">1806</a>, was acquired by the University and the use of it given to the Gardners, who contributed to its restoration and gave the Orchard Avenue house to Brown. On April 14, <a href="articles/1935.html">1935</a> the Gardners held an informal house-warming, at which <a href="articles/Mead, Albert D..html">Albert Mead</a> dedicated the Henry Ames Barker room in memory of Mrs. Gardner’s brother “to all the interests, civic and artistic, that filled his life,” and communicated her wish that the room would serve as a meeting place for groups in the college or city who wish to carry on this work. Henry Ames Barker <a href="articles/1893.html">1893</a> was the author, with A. E. Thomas <a href="articles/1894.html">1894</a>, of a play, “In Colony Times,” for the sesquicentennial celebration of the University in <a href="articles/1914.html">1914</a>. The house is used as lodging for guests of the University, and for many years Mabelle Chappell <a href="articles/1933.html">1933</a> served as resident hostess.</p>
