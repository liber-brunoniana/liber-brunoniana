Although the academy lasted only until <a href="./1767.html">1767</a>, many Baptist ministers, as well as some who entered other professions, received the rudiments of an education there. Of these, probably the most important was <a href="./Manning, James.html">James Manning</a>, who became the first president of Rhode Island College, later Brown University. <a href="./Howell, David.html">David Howell</a>, the first professor at Brown, also studied there.
