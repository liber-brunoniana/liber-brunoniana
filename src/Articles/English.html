<p>English as a department of instruction was preceded by rhetoric, one of the most important subjects in the early years of the College. The Laws of <a href="./1774.html">1774</a> required that each evening two students would “ldquo;pronounce on the Stage,”rdquo; and the seniors and juniors would write a weekly “ldquo;Dispute”rdquo; on assigned topics. Although early compositions showed a certain disregard for spelling and grammar, the College gained recognition for its orators, particularly under <a href="./President.html">President</a> <a href="./Maxcy, Jonathan.html">Jonathan Maxcy</a>. When Nicholas Brown contributed the $5,000 which changed the name of the College in <a href="./1804.html">1804</a>, he specified that the money should be used to establish a Professorship of Oratory and Belles Letters (sic), a hope which his uncle John Brown had expressed in a letter the previous year. <a href="./Burges, Tristam.html">Tristam Burges</a> <a href="./1796.html">1796</a> was named to the professorship in <a href="./1815.html">1815</a>. In <a href="./1821.html">1821</a> he began a course of lectures. Before that time the weekly composition had been corrected by the other professors. After that, as Burges complained in a letter written in <a href="./1826.html">1826</a>, the whole of the work had been assigned to him and had become a burden, although “ldquo;The young men are, some times, considerate; &amp; do not <i>all</i> write; &amp; the two present Classes relieve me, in a more creditable manner; that is by writing very correctly.”rdquo; Burges was soon relieved of his burden, after the arrival of <a href="./Wayland, Francis.html">Francis Wayland</a> as president in <a href="./1827.html">1827</a>.  When Wayland decreed that all professors should occupy rooms in the college, Burges, who had been elected a member of the United States House of Representatives, had to resign his professorship. <a href="./Goddard, William Giles.html">William Giles Goddard</a> was professor of belles lettres from <a href="./1834.html">1834</a> until his resignation in <a href="./1842.html">1842</a>. <a href="./Gammell, William.html">William Gammell</a>, assistant professor of belles lettres from <a href="./1835.html">1835</a>, was named professor of rhetoric in <a href="./1837.html">1837</a>. Gammell switched to teaching history in <a href="./1850.html">1850</a>, and <a href="./Dunn, Robinson P..html">Robinson P. Dunn</a> took over instruction in rhetoric and English literature until <a href="./1867.html">1867</a>. <a href="./Bancroft, Timothy Whiting.html">Timothy Whiting Bancroft</a> became professor of rhetoric and English literature in <a href="./1868.html">1868</a>.</p><p>Instruction in logic was part of the responsibility of the professor of rhetoric and English literature until <a href="./1874.html">1874</a> when it was removed to the Department of <a href="./Mathematics.html">Mathematics</a>. In <a href="./1873.html">1873</a>-74 Bancroft introduced the reading of Chaucer with early English pronunciation and recommended the establishment of a professorship of Anglo-Saxon and early English, “ldquo;a department now generally maintained in our leading colleges.”rdquo; An editorial in the <i><a href="./Brunonian.html">Brunonian</a></i> of February 24, <a href="./1883.html">1883</a> complained of the poor provision for instruction in the English Department, “ldquo;One sadly overworked mortal is compelled to give instruction in composition and rhetoric, including argumentation, Anglo-Saxon language and literature, with the development of the English language, English literature, Chaucer and Shakspere, to say nothing of being obliged to wade through four hundred sophomore essays, and to writhe beneath an indefinite number of junior orations.”rdquo; The burden was too much for Professor Bancroft, who suffered a breakdown that year. <a href="./President.html">President</a> Robinson, recommending in his <a href="./1883.html">1883</a> report that the duties of the department should be divided between a professor of rhetoric and a professor of English literature, wrote, “ldquo;the most radical defect to-day in our American colleges is a want of due attention to rhetorical studies, understanding by these studies not only practice in the arts of composition and of speech ... but also that correctness of literary taste, that knowledge of English literature and that appreciation of its riches, without which facility and skill in the use of our tongue are never attainable.”rdquo;</p><p>After the tragic death of Bancroft the department was divided. <a href="./Sears, Lorenzo.html">Lorenzo Sears</a> became associate professor of rhetoric in <a href="./1890.html">1890</a>, associate professor of rhetoric and oratory in <a href="./1892.html">1892</a>, and associate professor of American literature in <a href="./1895.html">1895</a>, at which time Hammond Lamont took over rhetoric and oratory. Students in Sears’s American literature course made weekly reports on six hours of outside reading of American authors. He also gave a course on “ldquo;The Occasional Oration as a Type of Literature and Composition,”rdquo; designed “ldquo;to qualify the student to meet a demand which is frequently made upon educated men to deliver an unprofessional address on an occasion of public interest.”rdquo; In <a href="./1891.html">1891</a> <a href="./Snow, Louis F..html">Louis F. Snow</a>, instructor in elocution, was allowed to offer a special elective in Shakespeare for seniors. John Matthews Manly was associate professor of English language and literature in <a href="./1891.html">1891</a>-92, and changed his position to associate professor of English language in <a href="./1892.html">1892</a>, when <a href="./Bronson, Walter C..html">Walter C. Bronson</a> began to teach English literature. In <a href="./1895.html">1895</a>-96 the English Department under Professor Bronson offered a new Introductory Course in English Literature, taught by three faculty members. The course was elected by one hundred students at the University and about forty at the Women’s College. Of these, Bronson was disappointed to observe, “ldquo;The year’s experience has strongly confirmed our belief that such a course was much needed. We have found nine-tenths of the class quite untrained in habits of intelligent and appreciative reading. ... Next year we shall make the instruction even more elementary and practical.”rdquo;</p><p><a href="./Thomas Crosby.html">Thomas Crosby</a> succeeded Lamont in <a href="./1901.html">1901</a>, with the title of assistant professor of English and public speaking. <a href="./Potter, Albert K..html">Albert K.

Professor <a href="./Bronson, Walter C..html">Walter C.

Foster Damon, <a href="./Anderson, George K..html">George K. Anderson</a> and <a href="./Brown, Sharon.html">Sharon Brown</a>. Courses were divided into two groups, undergraduate courses and courses intended for both undergraduates and graduate students. This change differentiated between elementary and advanced work, and also allowed access to advanced courses earlier in a student’s college career. The three assistant professors remained at Brown, and until they retired, Damon taught courses in Blake and Milton, Anderson in Chaucer, Beowulf, and Old and Middle English, and <a href="./Brown, Sharon.html">Sharon Brown</a> in Victorian literature and poetry.
