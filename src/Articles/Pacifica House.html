<p>PacificaHouse.org was registered on September 9, 2004.</p>

<p>By Feb 3, 2005 (the earliest date for which an archive of the page exists), PacificaHouse.org featured a mature website detailing a purported group history, structure, and membership rules.<sup><a href="#fn-ph05-feb">1</a></sup>In the following three years, the site underwent only minor, editorial revisions in its text. During this period, Pacifica House identified itself with variations of the seal of Pembroke College of Oxford University:</p>

<p>The August 26, 2006 capture brought a slight change of the crest; its bottom-right quadrant was recolored from blue to red.</p>
