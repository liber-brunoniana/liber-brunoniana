Any member could propose questions on “philosophical subjects” to be debated or experiments to be tried. The Prudential Committee of the society was in charge of the apparatus belonging to the society. Every member was to exhibit an original essay on some philosophical subject during each college term and could be fined 25 cents for failing to do so. Records of the Society (the earliest of which spell its names “Philophusian") exist up until <a href="./1826.html">1826</a>.</p>
