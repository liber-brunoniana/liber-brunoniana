<p>Andrews House, at 13 Brown Street, was opened on January 4, <a href="./1939.html">1939</a>, as a 50-bed infirmary, replacing the former infirmary at 10 Manning Street. The property had been purchased in <a href="./1922.html">1922</a> and used as the <a href="./Faculty Club.html">Faculty Club</a> since that time. The 29-room mansion, of which Ogden Codman of New York was the architect, was erected in <a href="./1901.html">1901</a> for James Coats and was later the residence of Alfred P. Coats, textile manufacturer. It served as the Governorâ€™s Mansion during the administration of R. Livingston Beekman, Governor of Rhode Island from <a href="./1915.html">1915</a> to <a href="./1921.html">1921</a>, who resided there in the <a href="./English.html">English</a> splendor he so much admired. The remodelling as an infirmary was made possible through the gift of $330,000 by Charles Henry Hare <a href="./1885.html">1885</a> and $60,000 from other sources. Andrews House was chosen as the name of the remodeled building in honor of <a href="./President.html">President</a> E. Benjamin Andrews, because, since the abandonment of <a href="./Andrews Field.html">Andrews Field</a> as the athletic field at Brown, there was no physical structure on the campus to honor his memory.</p>
