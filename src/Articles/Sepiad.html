<p>Sepiad was the literary magazine of the Women’s College, which first appeared in April <a href="./1901.html">1901</a>, brought forth by the efforts of Florence Rafter ’01, the first editor, Jessie Wheeler ’01, and Grace Jones ’01. The name of the publication was inspired by a poem by Professor <a href="./Langdon, Courtney.html">Courtney Langdon</a> in the <i><a href="./Brunonian.html">Brunonian</a></i> of December 3, <a href="./1892.html">1892</a>, “The Sepiades,” which he called</p><blockquote>“A fairer name<br />“Than Adjunctivas or Co-Eds.”</blockquote>for the newly arrived women students. A less than chivalrous review in the <i>Brown Daily Herald</i> suggested “Sleepy-’ead” as an appropriate name. The magazine contained essays, fiction, and poetry by the women students, along with the departments “College Notes,” “Free Press,” and “Alumnae Notes.” It came out monthly in <a href="./1901.html">1901</a>-<a href="./1902.html">1902</a>, quarterly from <a href="./1902.html">1902</a> to <a href="./1928.html">1928</a>, and irregularly from <a href="./1929.html">1929</a> to its end in <a href="./1932.html">1932</a>. On November 18, <a href="./1919.html">1919</a> a small newspaper called <i>Sepiad Supplement</i> was issued after gaining the approval of a mass meeting of Student Government Association. This new publication served the purpose of removing the college news and the departments and allowing the <i>Sepiad</i> to become a literary magazine. Five issues were published the first year. The next year the <i>Sepiad Supplement</i> came out about every three weeks, and by <a href="./1922.html">1922</a> it became a newspaper in its own right, changing its title to <i>The Record.</i>
