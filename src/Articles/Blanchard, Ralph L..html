Professor <a href="articles/Brown, Sharon.html">Sharon Brown</a> wrote in his memorial minute:</p><blockquote>“Ralph Blanchard was a perfectionist in an imperfect world. Equally qualified to teach mathematics or Latin, he elected to teach the most intractable of subjects, <a href="articles/English.html">English</a> composition, and strove patiently to imbue his students with his own respect for good style.... Somewhat austere in character, he was gentle at heart, with quiet tastes. Country born, he never outgrew his attachment for country living. In many ways he suggested Henry Thoreau, not only in the purity of his prose style but in his love of country solitude, his familiarity with birds and bees, trees and wild flowers, and his sympathy with humble lives close to the soil.” </blockquote>
