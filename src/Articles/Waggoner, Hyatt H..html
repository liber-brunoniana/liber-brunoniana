He came to Brown as professor of <a href="./English.html">English</a> in <a href="./1956.html">1956</a>. He was director of the <a href="./American Civilization.html">American Civilization</a> program from <a href="./1960.html">1960</a> to <a href="./1970.html">1970</a>.

He did not, however, devote himself to Hawthorne. As he said, “I’ve moved around the field at the risk of being superficial.” His first book, in <a href="./1950.html">1950</a>, <i>The Heel of Elohim,</i> was subtitled <i>Science and Values in Modern American <a href="./Poetry.html">Poetry</a>.</i> His other books included <i>William Faulkner: From Jefferson to the World</i> in <a href="./1959.html">1959</a>, <i>Emerson as Poet</i> in <a href="./1974.html">1974</a>, and <i>American Visionary <a href="./Poetry.html">Poetry</a></i> in <a href="./1982.html">1982</a>. His <i>American Poets: From the Puritans to the Present,</i> published in <a href="./1968.html">1968</a>, was a 740-page volume which grew out of one of his courses. Waggoner, who attended a one-room school in upstate New York, was always a nature-lover, fond of camping and hiking. When he was a freshman at Middlebury, his perception of the conflict of science and theology led him to write to his Presbyterian pastor that he could not continue to be a “nominal Christian.” He attended a Unitarian Church in the 1940s, was an Episcopalian through the 1950s, until his religious meanderings led him to a small federated church near his farmhouse in Rochester, Vermont. In the woodshed of his farm he wrote his books during summer vacations and sabbatical leaves. He never wrote during the school year, when his attention belonged to his courses and his students. John Shroeder, who became a professor of <a href="./English.html">English</a> at Brown, was one of Waggoner’s students in Kansas City, where, Shroeder recalled, “Hyatt had small classes. He taught in his office, sitting behind his desk. There were no pyrotechnics, but he was inspiring. He had new and startling ideas about literary matters.... He set people up well enough to continue for themselves. And he was what students are always hoping for in a professor. I always felt free to drop in on him and talk about literary matters for two hours. He was always available. He gave exams on the porch of his house and served beer. I make him sound sugary and sweet. He is really a cranky Yankee.” Waggoner retired from teaching in <a href="./1979.html">1979</a>. He died on October 13, <a href="./1988.html">1988</a> in Hanover, New Hampshire.</p>
