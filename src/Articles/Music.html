<p>Music was included in the Department of Fine Arts when it was first taught in <a href="./1895.html">1895</a> by Joseph N. Ashton <a href="./1891.html">1891</a>, who had been appointed instructor of musical theory and history. Ashton was promoted to associate professor in <a href="./1898.html">1898</a>, and in <a href="./1900.html">1900</a> became director of chapel music. During the first year of the <a href="./Sayles Hall.html">Sayles Hall</a> organ he conducted two series of concerts, before his resignation in <a href="./1904.html">1904</a>. No classes in music are listed in the course announcement for the years <a href="./1904.html">1904</a>-05 through <a href="./1907.html">1907</a>-08. The next year Hamilton MacDougall of Wellesley College acted as lecturer in music on a temporary basis, teaching a course in “ldquo;The Evolution of Modern Music.”rdquo; In <a href="./1909.html">1909</a>-10 Arthur Ware Locke (Harvard <a href="./1894.html">1894</a>), who had taught at St. Paul’s School in Concord, New Hampshire, and had studied in Berlin and Paris, was was instructor in music, teaching the same course. The next year Professor MacDougall returned, and until his departure in <a href="./1914.html">1914</a> the music courses varying from year to year covered elementary and advanced harmony, the symphony, and the opera. Edwin Ernest Wilde, who was also in charge of music at St. Stephen’s Church, was lecturer in music at Brown from <a href="./1914.html">1914</a> to <a href="./1920.html">1920</a>. Gene Wilder Ware ’06, who had been director of chapel music since <a href="./1906.html">1906</a>, became lecturer in music in <a href="./1920.html">1920</a>, and assistant professor of music in <a href="./1923.html">1923</a>.</p><p>The department occupied two first floor rooms in the dormitory at 36 Prospect Street in <a href="./1924.html">1924</a>. In <a href="./1929.html">1929</a> Brown entered into an affiliation with St. Dunstan’s College of Sacred Music, which made it unnecessary for Brown to give advanced courses in music and allowed students at St. Dunstan’s to take courses at Brown. In <a href="./1930.html">1930</a>, for the first time Brown students were able to major in music, and for the first time in <a href="./1930.html">1930</a>-31 credit was given for work in applied music, as students who had already had training in singing or playing instruments upon examination were allowed to continue their training under an approved teacher. Also, in <a href="./1930.html">1930</a>, Arlan Coolidge ’26 succeeded Gene Ware as professor of music. As the only member of the department he taught two courses in music appreciation. He was named chairman of the department in <a href="./1939.html">1939</a>, a post he held until <a href="./1963.html">1963</a>. In <a href="./1932.html">1932</a> the student musical organizations were put under the direction of the department. When St. Dunstan’s withdrew from work of college grade in <a href="./1932.html">1932</a>, the Music Department added a new course in elementary theory. The department grew steadily with the arrival of William Dinneen in <a href="./1938.html">1938</a>, Francis K. C. Madeira in <a href="./1943.html">1943</a>, Edward B. Greene in <a href="./1946.html">1946</a>, Martin Fischer in <a href="./1947.html">1947</a>, Otto van Koppenhagen in <a href="./1949.html">1949</a>, Millard S. Thomson and Mildred Pansy in <a href="./1950.html">1950</a>, David Laurent in <a href="./1951.html">1951</a>, Ron Nelson in <a href="./1956.html">1956</a>, and Paul Nelson in <a href="./1964.html">1964</a>.</p><p>Professor Ron Nelson, a graduate of the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester, became chairman in <a href="./1963.html">1963</a>. His cantata, <i>The Christmas Story,</i> was first performed at Brown, and his <i>Triumphal Te Deum</i> became part of Brown’s annual Latin Carol Service in <a href="./1962.html">1962</a>.</p><p>When Professor Coolidge retired in <a href="./1967.html">1967</a>, the department offered thirty courses. A new concentration in non-Western music was added in <a href="./1971.html">1971</a>. In <a href="./1971.html">1971</a>, when enrollment in applied music had increased 300% in the preceding five years, students sought more space for the Music Department by staging a demonstration in <a href="./University Hall.html">University Hall</a>. As a result the department was given a building on the East <a href="./Campus.html">Campus</a> at 148 Power Street. With contributions from the Steinert Foundation the building was fitted with soundproof practice rooms and an electropiano laboratory in which the sound of piano-playing is heard through earphones. In <a href="./1973.html">1973</a> 1,400 undergraduates of the University’s 4,700 were taking courses in music. The houses on College Street which the department occupied were outgrown. A grant from the Kresge Foundation made possible the conversion of South Hall on the East <a href="./Campus.html">Campus</a> into a new home for the Music Department, which was later named the <a href="./Orwig Music Center.html">Orwig Music Center</a>. A new wing on the building in <a href="./1988.html">1988</a> added a music library. Students of music can now specialize in composition, musicology, and ethnomusicology. Among the courses featuring rehearsal and performance are offerings in old time string band, chamber music, chorus, orchestra, wind symphony, Ghanaian drumming and dance, and the gamelan music of Bali. The department chairmen after Coolidge have been Ron Nelson, David Laurent, David Josephson, Gerald M. Shapiro, and James M. Baker.</p>
