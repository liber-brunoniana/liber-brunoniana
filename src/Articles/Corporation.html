<p>The Corporation created by the <a href="./Charter.html">Charter</a> in <a href="./1764.html">1764</a> consisted of two branches, the Trustees and the Fellows. Originally, the Trustees numbered 36, of whom 22 were to be Baptists, five Friends, four Congregationalists, and five Episcopalians. The Board of Fellows included the president among its twelve members, of whom originally eight were chosen from the Baptists and “ldquo;the rest indifferently of any and all denominations.”rdquo; An Executive Board, composed of conservative members and entrusted with some of the functions which the <a href="./Charter.html">Charter</a> had reserved for the Board of Fellows, was created in <a href="./1850.html">1850</a>. The Executive Board took over the immediate government of the University, not without some resentment, and had considerable power. In <a href="./1863.html">1863</a> the University also created a committee of public lands to be responsible for the agricultural lands assigned to the University as a result of the Morrill Act in <a href="./1862.html">1862</a>. The demand of the Executive Board that the committee must report to it resulted in a controversy which brought about the abolition of the Executive Board on the grounds that its assumption of duties of the Board of Fellows violated the <a href="./Charter.html">Charter</a>.</p><p>The <a href="./Charter.html">Charter</a> was amended in <a href="./1926.html">1926</a> to add six trustees, to be chosen without regard to religious affiliation, bringing the number of trustees to 42. At the same time the requirement that the president be a Baptist was removed. In <a href="./1942.html">1942</a> another amendment removed all denominational requirements for Corporation members. <a href="./President.html">President</a> Wriston had his own set of qualifications for a good Corporation member. Soon after his arrival at Brown, when asked what he expected of a Corporation member, he replied, “ldquo;work, wealth, and wisdom, preferably all three, but at least two of the three.”rdquo;</p><p>For many years after the Women’s College had been established, no thought was given to representation of the women on the Corporation. In <a href="./1927.html">1927</a> Nettie Goodale Murdock ’95 and Magel Wilder ’19 addressed a letter to the Corporation suggesting that women should be represented. The Corporation replied on October 21, <a href="./1927.html">1927</a> that “ldquo;the time had not arrived for the election of a woman to membership.”rdquo; At the Corporation meeting in June <a href="./1928.html">1928</a> it was voted to add an alumna to the Executive Committee of the Women’s College. Mrs. Murdock, who was chosen as the first such member, greeted this gesture as a recognition of the “ldquo;strength and importance of the alumnae body,”rdquo; although she later pointed out the inconsistency of being a member of a Corporation committee without being a member of the Corporation. The first woman member of the Corporation was Anna Canada Swain ’11, who was chosen as a term trustee in <a href="./1949.html">1949</a>. In <a href="./1965.html">1965</a> for the first time a Pembroke alumna was nominated for a membership on the Board of Trustees under a new agreement between the <a href="./Associated Alumni.html">Associated Alumni</a> and the Pembroke <a href="./Alumnae Association.html">Alumnae Association</a>. The agreement provided that the fourteen alumni trustee members, all of whom had previously been men, would now be divided between ten alumni and four alumnae. The method of fulfilling this ratio after the initial four women were elected was the provision that after <a href="./1970.html">1970</a> two alumni would be elected each year and one alumnae would be elected in four out of every five years. The first elected alumna trustee was Elizabeth Goodale Kenyon ’39 in <a href="./1965.html">1965</a>. Appointed to the Board of Fellows in <a href="./1969.html">1969</a> were first woman member, Doris Brown Reed ’27, who had been a term trustee since <a href="./1963.html">1963</a>, the first African-American member, <a href="./Redding, Jay Saunders.html">Jay Saunders Redding</a> ’28, and the first Jewish member, Alfred Joslin H. ’35</p><p>Although the <a href="./Charter.html">Charter</a> provided that a trustee or fellow may hold his office “ldquo;during life or until resignation,”rdquo; the Corporation has chosen to impose some limitations on the length of terms. One third of the trustees are alumni/ alumnae trustees, who are nominated by the <a href="./Associated Alumni.html">Associated Alumni</a>, serve for six-year terms, and cannot be renominated until a year after leaving the Board. The remaining trustees are term trustees, nominated by the Committee on Trustee Vacancies for a term of six years, and restricted, except for unusual circumstances, from serving consecutive terms. Until <a href="./1981.html">1981</a> the Fellows were elected for life. Since <a href="./1981.html">1981</a> they have been elected for eleven year terms and are eligible for reelection. The Chancellor, Vice Chancellor, and <a href="./Treasurer.html">Treasurer</a> of the University are chosen from the Trustees and the Secretary of the Corporation is chosen from the Fellows. The Chancellor acts as Moderator of the Trustees and the <a href="./President.html">President</a> is the Moderator of the Fellows.</p><p>When the full Corporation meets, both boards meet in the same room, on different sides of an aisle, and both bodies transact their business in the same meeting. A motion by either Board is discussed by both Boards, and must first be passed by the Board which originated it and then ratified by the other. Although the Trustees may not meet without the Fellows, the Fellows may meet alone, as the awarding of degrees belongs by provision of the <a href="./Charter.html">Charter</a> to the Fellows. The full Corporation meets three times a year, in October, February, and at <a href="./Commencement.html">Commencement</a>. A quorum of the Corporation is twelve trustees and five fellows. Business, with certain exceptions, can be transacted by a “ldquo;minor quorum,”rdquo; which consists of four trustees and three fellows. The Advisory and Executive Committee, consisting of the <a href="./President.html">President</a>, Chancellor, Vice Chancellor, Secretary, <a href="./Treasurer.html">Treasurer</a>, and nine other members of the Corporation, meets as a minor quorum during the academic year in the months when there is no Corporation meeting. The ongoing functions of the Corporation are providing for the continuity of the University through its membership, providing financial support and control, reviewing major policies, advising the administration and the University community, providing formal approval to matters reserved to the Corporation, electing a president who is responsible to the Corporation, and providing for the Corporation’s own succession.</p><p>The Secretaries of the Corporation have been Thomas Eyres from <a href="./1764.html">1764</a> to <a href="./1776.html">1776</a>; Thomas Arnold <a href="./1771.html">1771</a> from <a href="./1776.html">1776</a> to <a href="./1780.html">1780</a>; <a href="./Howell, David.html">David Howell</a> from <a href="./1780.html">1780</a> to <a href="./1806.html">1806</a>; Samuel Eddy <a href="./1787.html">1787</a> from <a href="./1806.html">1806</a> to <a href="./1829.html">1829</a>; Nathan Bourne Crocker from <a href="./1829.html">1829</a> to <a href="./1837.html">1837</a>; Theron Metcalf <a href="./1805.html">1805</a> from <a href="./1837.html">1837</a> to <a href="./1843.html">1843</a>; <a href="./Goddard, William Giles.html">William Giles Goddard</a> <a href="./1812.html">1812</a> from <a href="./1843.html">1843</a> to <a href="./1846.html">1846</a>; Nathan Bourne Crocker from <a href="./1846.html">1846</a> to <a href="./1853.html">1853</a>; <a href="./Kingsbury, John.html">John Kingsbury</a> <a href="./1826.html">1826</a> from <a href="./1853.html">1853</a> to <a href="./1874.html">1874</a>; Samuel Lunt Caldwell from <a href="./1875.html">1875</a> to <a href="./1889.html">1889</a>; Thomas D.
