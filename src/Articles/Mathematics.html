<p>Mathematics was required of students from the earliest days of the College. The Laws of <a href="./1783.html">1783</a> required that the applicant for admission shall have “ldquo;learned the rules of ... Vulgar Arithmetic.”rdquo; In <a href="./1828.html">1828</a> the annual catalogue noted that an entering student “ldquo;must be well acquainted with ... Colburn’s Algebra, as far as Quadratick Equations.”rdquo; According to the Laws of <a href="./1793.html">1793</a>, students were exposed to “ldquo;Fennings Arithmetic, Hammonds Algebra, Stones Euclid, Martins Trigonometry, Loves Surveying, Wilsons Navigation,”rdquo; but not until the third year of their studies, the first two having been occupied largely by the <a href="./Classics.html">Classics</a>, rhetoric, and oratory. The professors of mathematics during the first hundred years included <a href="./West, Benjamin.html">Benjamin West</a>, who lectured from <a href="./1786.html">1786</a> to <a href="./1798.html">1798</a>, <a href="./Messer, Asa.html">Asa Messer</a> whose title was professor of mathematics and natural philosophy from <a href="./1799.html">1799</a> to <a href="./1802.html">1802</a> and who continued to teach after becoming president in <a href="./1802.html">1802</a>, <a href="./Adams, Jasper.html">Jasper Adams</a> from <a href="./1819.html">1819</a> to <a href="./1824.html">1824</a>, <a href="./Woods, Alva.html">Alva Woods</a> from <a href="./1824.html">1824</a> to <a href="./1828.html">1828</a>, <a href="./Caswell, Alexis.html">Alexis Caswell</a> from <a href="./1828.html">1828</a> to <a href="./1863.html">1863</a>, and <a href="./Greene, Samuel Stillman.html">Samuel Stillman Greene</a> from <a href="./1855.html">1855</a> to <a href="./1864.html">1864</a>. For a number of years the faculty of the department were Brown graduates. Immediately after his graduation in <a href="./1863.html">1863</a>, Benjamin F. Clarke became instructor in mathematics, advancing to professor of mathematics and civil engineering in <a href="./1868.html">1868</a>. Nathaniel French Davis <a href="./1870.html">1870</a> returned to Brown in <a href="./1874.html">1874</a> as instructor in mathematics and remained until <a href="./1915.html">1915</a>, being named professor of pure mathematics in <a href="./1890.html">1890</a>. In <a href="./1874.html">1874</a>-75 the study of logic was removed from the professorship of rhetoric and was joined to mathematics. Henry Parker Manning <a href="./1883.html">1883</a> introduced previously unavailable courses in higher mathematics at Brown, when he returned after earning his Ph.D. degree at Johns Hopkins in <a href="./1891.html">1891</a>. Clinton Currier <a href="./1898.html">1898</a>, who began as an instructor in <a href="./1899.html">1899</a>, added astronomy to his teaching duties in <a href="./1914.html">1914</a>. In <a href="./1907.html">1907</a> Professor Roland G. D. Richardson came to Brown from Nova Scotia by way of Yale. He was chairman of the department from <a href="./1914.html">1914</a> to <a href="./1942.html">1942</a>, and secretary of the American Mathematical Society from <a href="./1921.html">1921</a> to <a href="./1940.html">1940</a>. Appointments during Richardson’s chairmanship included <a href="./Archibald, Raymond C..html">Raymond C. Archibald</a>, also from Nova Scotia, in <a href="./1907.html">1907</a>, C.

Tamarkin</a> came from Russia in <a href="./1927.html">1927</a> and taught until <a href="./1946.html">1946</a>. Between <a href="./1933.html">1933</a> and <a href="./1935.html">1935</a> Hans Lewy and Otto Szasz taught at Brown under the provision of the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German Scholars. George Polya from Hungary was a visiting professor from <a href="./1940.html">1940</a> to <a href="./1942.html">1942</a>. <a href="./President.html">President</a> Wriston announced in his annual report in June <a href="./1939.html">1939</a>:</p><blockquote>“ldquo;The year has seen a remarkable development in connection with the Mathematics Department. It became known late in the fall that Professor <a href="./Neugebauer, Otto.html">Otto Neugebauer</a>, the distinguished editor of the <i>Zentralblatt für Mathematik</i> and also of the <i>Quellen und Studien zur Geschichte der Mathematik, Astronomie und Physik,</i> was available for an American appointment, and after negotiations he was offered an appointment as Professor of Mathematics at Brown University. Assistance in meeting the salary commitment was granted by the Carnegie <a href="./Corporation.html">Corporation</a>, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars. We also appointed his assistant, Mr. Olaf Schmidt, who has been working with him for some years.<p>“ldquo;Professor Neugebauer paid a visit to this country this spring and found rich material for his researches. At the same time the American Mathematical Society decided to establish an international journal of mathematical abstracts, to be known as <i>Mathematical Reviews,</i> and located that journal at Brown, appointing Professors Neugebauer and Tamarkin its editors. The Society also made available the necessary funds to bring Dr. Willy Feller as assistant to the editors and as lecturer in Brown University.</p><p>“ldquo;The Rockefeller Foundation has granted a request for a grant to make available in photographic form all the significant material on mathematics which has been published and which is not presently available here. The proposed laboratory will also make copies of articles and extracts from books available to mathematical scholars everywhere at nominal cost, so that men who are in institutions without large mathematical libraries and who note works in the <i>Mathematical Reviews</i> which bear upon the field of their special interest may have full copies for their own use.</p><p>“ldquo;In the course of the last few years the center of research in mathematics has shifted to the United States. The library at Brown is already one of the most distinguished collections in the world. The recent developments bid fair to make it even more so, and to make this institution a center for mathematical research known the world around.”rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>In the summer of <a href="./1941.html">1941</a> a Program of Advanced Instruction and Research in Mechanics was organized by Professor Richardson with the support of the U.S. Office of <a href="./Education.html">Education</a> and the Carnegie Foundation. The program grew into the Division of <a href="./Applied Mathematics.html">Applied Mathematics</a>.</p><p>Professor C. Raymond Adams was chairman of the Department of Mathematics from <a href="./1942.html">1942</a> to <a href="./1960.html">1960</a>. New additions to the faculty were Bjarni Jonsson and Herbert Federer in <a href="./1946.html">1946</a>, Frank M. Stewart in <a href="./1947.html">1947</a>, and E.H. Lee in <a href="./1948.html">1948</a>. A program leading to the Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics was initiated in <a href="./1969.html">1969</a> for students who wished to add more study in science to the pure mathematics program. Chairmen of the department after Adams have been David Gale, Wendell H. Fleming, Bruno Harris, John Wermer, Allan H. Clark, Robert D. Accola, Jonathan D. Lubin, Andrew Browder, Thomas Banchoff, William Fulton, and Walter A. Strauss.</p><p>The Mathematics Department moved in <a href="./1952.html">1952</a> to the old Delta Kappa Epsilon house, which was renamed <a href="./Howell House.html">Howell House</a>. The next move in <a href="./1961.html">1961</a>, necessitated by the impending razing of <a href="./Howell House.html">Howell House</a> to make room for the Rockefeller <a href="./Library.html">Library</a>, was to 155 Thayer Street, where the department occupied half a house which was given the name of <a href="./Howell House.html">Howell House</a>, the other half of which was already named <a href="./Ames House.html">Ames House</a>. In time the Mathematics Department used the whole house, and was finally given a spacious home in <a href="./Kassar House.html">Kassar House</a> with its new addition in <a href="./1990.html">1990</a>.</p>
