He taught at Deerfield Academy in <a href="./1920.html">1920</a>-21. After earning his master of arts degree at Brown in <a href="./1921.html">1921</a>, he was appointed to teach drama, public speaking and playwriting. He also took on Sock and Buskin, which had been staging one performance a year in a downtown theatre, and introduced a year-round program of dramatic productions. He was promoted to assistant professor of <a href="./English.html">English</a> and public speaking in <a href="./1926.html">1926</a> and associate professor in <a href="./1936.html">1936</a>. He was named director of dramatic productions in <a href="./1939.html">1939</a> and full professor in <a href="./1951.html">1951</a>.

When classes resumed in January <a href="./1955.html">1955</a> after the Christmas recess, Ben Brown did not appear. A colleague who went to his apartment found him disabled by a stroke apparently suffered two days earlier on January 3. He died in the hospital on January 7. In the memorial minute at the faculty meeting, Professor <a href="./Anderson, George K..html">George K. Anderson</a> said of him:</p><blockquote>“He belonged to what seems to be, unfortunately, an ever-decreasing group of true individualists. He was, in the best sense of the word, a “character,” a legend while still alive. Nowhere, not even on the stage, was his individual personality more evident and more valuable than in the classroom. His students remembered what he taught them because of the originality of his insights, the wealth of his analogies and comparisons, and the force of his delivery. His lectures were performances and each performance was an educational experience not to be forgotten.”</blockquote>Leslie Allen Jones ’26, who worked closely with Brown on Sock and Buskin productions, recalled:<blockquote>“He was, I think, a genius. His best teaching (and he was a good teacher) was done at midnight when he talked with the tired cast grouped about him on the stage.... I have never seen another man get so much out of undergraduates. He did not spoon-feed, he made them think. His standards were higher than some professionals.... He was child-like. There was his childish, petulant voice, when someone had done him wrong.... He was arrogant and willful, wrapped in his own delusions, and many people could not understand him. He liked that and went out of his way to shock and confound his academic colleagues.... He would bruise the undergraduates, who would then come to me bewildered at having discerned feet of clay or cloven hoof. And sometimes it was my good fortune to make them understand the sweet childishness of the man. For he was gentle at heart.”</blockquote>
