He was house physician at Bellevue in <a href="./1879.html">1879</a>-80. In <a href="./1884.html">1884</a> he was appointed superintendent of health in Providence, a post he held for forty-eight years. Meanwhile he was instructor in physiology at Brown from <a href="./1882.html">1882</a> to <a href="./1886.html">1886</a> and professor from <a href="./1886.html">1886</a> to <a href="./1895.html">1895</a>, city registrar of Providence from <a href="./1889.html">1889</a> to <a href="./1932.html">1932</a>, lecturer at Harvard Medical School in <a href="./1909.html">1909</a>, at Harvard-M.I.T.

In <a href="./1885.html">1885</a> the course was shortened to two hours per week and offered to sophomores, whose lack of preparation made his teaching difficult. He taught by the time-honored tradition of dictation without the use of a text book, conducted demonstrations with the human skeleton, and offered practical hygiene rules for the students. In <a href="./1889.html">1889</a> the course was restored to the junior year, and after <a href="./Delabarre, Edmund B..html">Edmund B. Delabarre</a> began to teach psychology in <a href="./1892.html">1892</a>, Chapin was able to drop the teaching of the nervous system.

In connection with his resignation as superintendent of health, the Rhode Island Medical Association adopted a resolution, which said, in part, “In the city, his two greatest achievements lie. First, in lifting Providence from a condition of well nigh medieval squalor in <a href="./1884.html">1884</a> – to the hygienic and sanitary perfection of today – and second, in the founding of our City Hospital and its later organization, in which he played so important part.” In <a href="./1931.html">1931</a> the Providence City Hospital was renamed Charles V. Chapin Hospital. Dr. Chapin died in Providence on January 31, <a href="./1941.html">1941</a>.</p>
