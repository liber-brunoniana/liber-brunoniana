<p>The Wriston Quadrangle was built between <a href="./1950.html">1950</a> and <a href="./1952.html">1952</a> on a site bordered by George, Thayer, Charles Field, and Brown Streets. The design by Perry, Shaw and Hepburn included nine residential buildings, which were built by the Gilbane Building Company in a Georgian style with a facing named “ldquo;<a href="./University Hall.html">University Hall</a> bond,”rdquo; consisting of three rows of brick the long way alternated with one row facing endwise. The typical building had a fraternity house on each wing and a dormitory in the central section. Movable partitions in the corridors could be adjusted to enlarge or contract the fraternity sections as needed by varying memberships. This idea was conceived by <a href="./President.html">President</a> Wriston to allow maximum usage of the rooms, by “ldquo;moving”rdquo; those not in use by a fraternity with a small membership into the dormitory section. A dry moat four feet deep around the quadrangle surrounded by a fence was designed for protection of lower floor windows. Fifty-one buildings, including houses, shops, and the Thayer Street School were razed from the site of the quadrangle. The school had been deeded to the University by the city in exchange for <a href="./Ames House.html">Ames House</a> at 121 Power Street. The architects tried, but in vain, to incorporate the Powel House, a Victorian mansion at the corner of George and Brown Streets built in <a href="./1865.html">1865</a> by Thomas Poynton Ives Goddard <a href="./1846.html">1846</a> into the plan. In September <a href="./1951.html">1951</a> students were living in five of the nine housing units, although some construction-related work still went on around them. The quadrangle was dedicated on June 1, <a href="./1952.html">1952</a> on a rainy day when Governor Dennis J. Roberts, architect Thomas Mott Shaw, contractors Thomas F. ’33 and William J. Gilbane ’33, and Arthur B. Homer ’17, chairman of the student housing board and donor of Wayland House, participated in the laying of the cornerstone.</p><p>The buildings were named for two Brown presidents and seven alumni, among them two Secretaries of State, three professors, a public health superintendent, and the man who led the Housing and Development campaign to finance the Quadrangle: Marcy House for William Learned Marcy <a href="./1808.html">1808</a>, Governor of New York, Secretary of War, and Secretary of State, Olney House for <a href="./Olney, Richard.html">Richard Olney</a> <a href="./1856.html">1856</a>, Attorney General and Secretary of State, Goddard House for <a href="./Goddard, William Giles.html">William Giles Goddard</a> <a href="./1812.html">1812</a>, newspaper editor and professor of moral philosophy and belles-lettres, Diman House for <a href="./Diman, Jeremiah Lewis.html">Jeremiah Lewis Diman</a> <a href="./1851.html">1851</a>, professor of history and political economy, Sears House for <a href="./Sears, Barnas.html">Barnas Sears</a> <a href="./1825.html">1825</a>, president from <a href="./1855.html">1855</a> to <a href="./1867.html">1867</a>, Wayland House for <a href="./Wayland, Francis.html">Francis Wayland</a>, president from <a href="./1827.html">1827</a> to <a href="./1855.html">1855</a>, Chapin House for <a href="./Chapin, Charles V..html">Charles V.
