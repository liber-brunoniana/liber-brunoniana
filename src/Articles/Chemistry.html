<p>Chemistry was taught at Brown for the first time in <a href="articles/1811.html">1811</a>, when Dr. William C. Bowen was engaged to lecture to the medical students, which he did until <a href="articles/1813.html">1813</a>. The position was offered to Dr. John Mackie, who declined. In <a href="articles/1817.html">1817</a> <a href="articles/D’Wolf, John.html">John D’Wolf</a> was appointed professor of chemistry. He had studied at Brown with the Class of <a href="articles/1806.html">1806</a> and later studied with Dr. Robert Hare of Philadelphia. D’Wolf was paid $600 a year and given $500 for apparatus, which he soon overspent. He continued to teach until the demise of the medical school in <a href="articles/1827.html">1827</a>. Chemistry was listed as a subject taught in the second term of senior year in the annual catalogue of <a href="articles/1828.html">1828</a>. The <a href="articles/1829.html">1829</a>-30 catalogue stated that the senior class “have used the treatise of Brande for a text-book,” and the <a href="articles/1830.html">1830</a>-31 catalogue announced that the seniors had studied chemistry, among other subjects, under Professor Caswell, professor of mathematics and natural philosophy, using the treatise of Dr. Turner, and observing “experimental illustrations, twice or thrice a week, as the subject might demand.” In <a href="articles/1833.html">1833</a>-34 <a href="articles/Chace, George Ide.html">George Ide Chace</a> was appointed adjunct professor of mathematics and natural philosophy, and the next year professor of chemistry. In <a href="articles/1836.html">1836</a> his title included also geology and physiology. When <a href="articles/Rhode Island Hall.html">Rhode Island Hall</a> was built in <a href="articles/1840.html">1840</a> to accommstudies, the first chemical laboratory was housed in the basement. In <a href="articles/1840.html">1840</a>-41 Chace gave lectures on chemistry which were open to the public in <a href="articles/Rhode Island Hall.html">Rhode Island Hall</a>.</p><p>The Newport Rogers Professorship of Chemistry was founded by a bequest of William Sanford Rogers in <a href="articles/1872.html">1872</a>. The first to hold this professorship was <a href="articles/Appleton, John Howard.html">John Howard Appleton</a> <a href="articles/1863.html">1863</a>, who was the founder and moving spirit of modern chemistry at Brown from <a href="articles/1865.html">1865</a> until his retirement in <a href="articles/1914.html">1914</a>. Appleton was a skillful analytical chemist, an able teacher and a writer of textbooks, but not a research chemist. Research in chemistry at Brown owes its start to the arrival of John C. Bucher in <a href="articles/1901.html">1901</a>. The first Ph.D. in chemistry was awarded in <a href="articles/1903.html">1903</a>. In <a href="articles/1910.html">1910</a>, when more students were taking chemistry, which was voluntary, than any other course except required <a href="articles/English.html">English</a> and mathematics, a laboratory for beginners was opened to relieve laboratory space needed for advanced students. Bucher left Brown in <a href="articles/1918.html">1918</a>.</p><p>The <a href="articles/Metcalf Chemical Laboratory.html">Metcalf Chemical Laboratory</a> was built in <a href="articles/1922.html">1922</a>, a gift of Jesse H. Metcalf. The appointment of Dr. <a href="articles/Kraus, Charles A..html">Charles A. Kraus</a> as professor of chemistry and director of laboratories in <a href="articles/1924.html">1924</a> brought a vigorous and dynamic leader to the department. The second floor of <a href="articles/Rogers Hall.html">Rogers Hall</a> became “The Newport-Rogers Laboratory of Chemistry,” with Dr. Kraus as director. New scholarships and fellowships in chemistry attracted students from distant states and from Europe for advanced study. The opening of the Metcalf Laboratory also brought about the institution of a new undergraduate course leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, which provided training for those who planned to pursue chemical research or to work in the chemical industry. In <a href="articles/1938.html">1938</a> the <a href="articles/Metcalf Research Laboratory.html">Metcalf Research Laboratory</a>, another gift from Mr. Metcalf, was built to Kraus’s specifications, with one exception – his idea that the top floor be used for dormitory space for graduate students did not appeal to <a href="articles/President.html">President</a> Wriston and got his veto. The laboratory’s facilities provided research equipment for twice as many graduate students and faculty members and opened existing laboratory space for undergraduates to conduct their own investigations. The new building also contained outstanding equipment for research not only in electrolytes, but also in photochemistry, the field of Professor W. Albert Noyes, Jr. During the Second World War many in the department, especially Professor Kraus, were involved with work for the Manhattan Project.</p><p>After Professor Paul C. Cross became chairman in <a href="articles/1947.html">1947</a>, he recruited Professors James S. Coles, Robert H. Cole, and <a href="articles/Hornig, Donald F..html">Donald F. Hornig</a>, who had worked at the Woods Hole Oceanograhic Institution or at <a href="articles/Los.html">Los</a> Alamos during the war. These four with Professor <a href="articles/Clapp, Leallyn B..html">Leallyn B. Clapp</a> led a resurgence in the department’s research and teaching. A radical change in the curriculum for chemistry majors put much of organic chemistry into the freshman year, with physical and inorganic chemistry following the next year for the sophomores. This proved to be too rapid an introduction to chemistry for most undergraduates, so by the time it became the curriculum for all chemistry students, an introductory semester of thermodynamics, kinetics, and equilibrium had been inserted before the start of the organic course which then began in the second semester. In <a href="articles/1952.html">1952</a>, Professor Coles left to become first president of Bowdoin College and then in <a href="articles/1968.html">1968</a> president of the Research <a href="articles/Corporation.html">Corporation</a>.</p><p>For many years the research in the department stressed physical chemistry almost to the exclusion of other fields. Professor Clapp helped to restore a more balanced program by starting his work in inorganic and organic chemistry. In <a href="articles/1957.html">1957</a> Professor Hornig left for Princeton. Professor <a href="articles/Gibbs, Julian H..html">Julian H. Gibbs</a> arrived in <a href="articles/1960.html">1960</a> and became an enthusiastic and active advocate for physical biochemistry at Brown. In <a href="articles/1979.html">1979</a> he became president of Amherst College. Professor John Ross contributed greatly by stimulating an increased emphasis on theoretical chemistry in the graduate curriculum. He moved to M.I.T. in <a href="articles/1966.html">1966</a> and to Stanford in <a href="articles/1979.html">1979</a>. In <a href="articles/1973.html">1973</a> Professor Clapp and in <a href="articles/1974.html">1974</a> Professor John O. Edwards received the Manufacturing Chemists Award for excellence in teaching chemistry, and in <a href="articles/1974.html">1974</a> Professor Cole received the Irving Langmuir Prize, this country’s highest award in chemical physics, for his work in dielectrics.</p><p>With the steadily increasing diversity of the interests of the members of the faculty and the complexity and size of the instrumentation required for modern chemistry the space available in the Metcalf Laboratories became seriously inadequate. The problem was solved with the construction of the GeoChem building into which the departments of chemistry and geological sciences moved in <a href="articles/1982.html">1982</a>. This fine, new building provided excellent space for the various research groups.</p><p>In the decade following the move to the new building the department’s research was spread over a wide range of chemistry. Included were work on the mechanisms of enzyme reactions and biosynthesis, the design of ligands for DNA, the synthesis of natural products, the electrochemistry of radicals and complexes, solid state chemistry, the structure of surfaces and the dynamics of their reactions with molecules, X-ray crystallography, the mechanisms of inorganic reactions, the infra-red and Raman spectroscopy of glasses, nuclear magnetic resonance applied to biological processes, laser studies of ultra fast processes in solution and in gaseous reactions, theoretical studies of clusters and surfaces, of the electronic structure of condensed phases, and of equations of state. With twenty faculty members the Chemistry Department was small enough so that its continuing tradition of friendly cooperation encouraged joint research projects and interactions between people having different specialties. The chairmen of the department since Kraus have been <a href="articles/Chambers, Robert F..html">Robert F. Chambers</a>, Paul C. Cross, Robert H. Cole, Joseph F. Bunnett, <a href="articles/Gibbs, Julian H..html">Julian H. Gibbs</a>, William M. Risen, Edward F. Greene, David E. Cane, and Peder J. Estrup.</p>
