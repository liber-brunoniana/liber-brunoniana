<p>The Fence around the campus was erected on <a href="articles/1903.html">1903</a> after the building of the <a href="articles/Van Wickle Gates.html">Van Wickle Gates</a>. The sections of the fence are 21 feet long and are separated by brick and stone piers. On each section of fence are the numerals of the class which contributed to the cost of that section, the cost at that time being $350. The numerals were originally in gold leaf, but the contrast with the black iron fence was deemed too great. The <a href="articles/1786.html">1786</a> section was not a gift of the long-departed class, but was given in honor of the class of Nicholas Brown. The gates in the fence are the <a href="articles/1872.html">1872</a> Gate on Prospect Street, the Robinson Gate on Waterman Street, a gift of the Class of <a href="articles/1884.html">1884</a> dedicated at <a href="articles/Commencement.html">Commencement</a> <a href="articles/1904.html">1904</a> in memory of <a href="articles/President.html">President</a> <a href="articles/Robinson, Ezekiel Gilman.html">Ezekiel Gilman Robinson</a>, and the <a href="articles/Class of 1887 Gate.html">Class of 1887 Gate</a> on Waterman Street. The gates on George Street are the <a href="articles/John Nicholas Brown Gate.html">John Nicholas Brown Gate</a>, given in <a href="articles/1903.html">1903</a> by his widow, the <a href="articles/Goddard, William Giles.html">William Goddard</a> Memorial Gate, given by Mrs. C.

The old gates which had stood at the head of College Street were removed to Thayer Street and were in time displaced once more by the <a href="articles/Soldiers Memorial Gate.html">Soldiers Memorial Gate</a>. Not all the sections were “sold” when the fence was new. The Class of <a href="articles/1923.html">1923</a> bought its section in <a href="articles/1956.html">1956</a>, paying $<a href="articles/2750.html">2750</a>, the estimated cost of adding a new section at that time.
