His detractors ridiculed him as “the man who is teaching girls Latin,” but his school prospered in its location in a school house formerly presided over by Oliver Angell. The school, as renovated by Kingsbury, was a novelty visited by and imitated by other schools with its previously unheard of luxuries, such as a carpeted floor and broadcloth covered desks.
