Modest and shunning publicity, he loved the quiet and still air of delightful study. His penetrating intelligence, his instantaneous reaction to any stimulus, his quick sense of humor made him beloved by a wide circle of friends. We never had a more conscientious teacher. In all his years at Brown he was absent only three times from any class because of illness. His father was a professor at Brown for 52 years and the son for 32 years, making a total of 84 years of classical teaching. It is doubtful if there is a parallel record in American colleges."</blockquote>
