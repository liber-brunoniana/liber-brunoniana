<p>The <a href="./Faculty.html">Faculty</a> Club was formed after the acquisition in <a href="./1922.html">1922</a> of the house at 13 Brown Street. <a href="./President.html">President</a> Faunce, in his annual report in October <a href="./1922.html">1922</a>, pointed out the desire of the University to improve the “mutual acquaintance which is the prerequisite of intellectual understanding and cooperation.” The club rooms on the first floor were furnished by the <a href="./Faculty.html">Faculty</a>, and Faunce announced that “Modest annual dues will make it possible for all to join the new organization.” The upper floors were rented as living quarters to single faculty members and also to assistants and graduate students. In <a href="./1938.html">1938</a> the <a href="./Faculty.html">Faculty</a> Club moved to the house at 1 Megee Street, the former home of <a href="./Allen, Zachariah.html">Zachariah Allen</a> <a href="./1813.html">1813</a>, designed by Alfred Stone and built in <a href="./1864.html">1864</a>, which had become the home of William Ely <a href="./1878.html">1878</a>. The house was officially called “Ely House.” At about the same time a new <a href="./Faculty.html">Faculty</a> House at 166 George Street was purchased to house bachelor faculty members who had lived at the old <a href="./Faculty.html">Faculty</a> Club, which was converted into an infirmary and named <a href="./Andrews House.html">Andrews House</a>.</p><p>Membership in the <a href="./Faculty.html">Faculty</a> Club was originally restricted to members of the faculty of professorial rank, full-time instructors, and administrative officers designated by the Board of Governors. Dining facilities were provided under the direction of the Cafe Committee. In <a href="./1944.html">1944</a> the Board of Governors admitted women to the main dining room. Traditional activities of the Club were annual smokers in the fall to introduce new faculty members and special luncheons with guest speakers held twice a month. In <a href="./1957.html">1957</a> a new room in the basement was opened as a self-service lunchroom and later in the afternoon as an informal cocktail lounge, for which the principal ingredients were stored by faculty members in rented lockers. The room was named the “Pine Room.” In <a href="./1975.html">1975</a> improvements were made to the building in the form of four new dining rooms. The basement room, now named the “<a href="./Brown Jug.html">Brown Jug</a>,” was decorated with memorabilia of the 1920s, and also with a Class D liquor license obtained in December <a href="./1975.html">1975</a>. At the same time the membership of the Club was augmented by the admission of alumni and alumnae members. A major renovation of the <a href="./Faculty.html">Faculty</a> Club was undertaken in <a href="./1980.html">1980</a>, when a one-story wing to the north and east, designed by Ira Rakatansky, was added, providing a main dining room for 100.</p>
