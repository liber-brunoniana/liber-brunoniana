<p>The Brown Family of Providence has maintained its connection with the University for two centuries. As Moses Brown said in a letter to <a href="./President.html">President</a> Wayland in <a href="./1833.html">1833</a>, discussing the relocation of the college from Warren to Providence, “ldquo;Thou may see by this, our family had an interest in promoting the Institution now called Brown University, besides the purchase of the name by my worthy nephew Nicholas.”rdquo;</p><p>The founding father of the Brown family in America was Chad Brown, who came from England to Boston in <a href="./1638.html">1638</a>. He soon moved to Providence and was one of the elders in Roger Williams’s new Baptist church. Chad’s son, John, was about eight years old when they came to America. The first three generations of the family were farmers, pastors and surveyors. James and Obadiah Brown of the fourth generation turned to trade with the West Indies, delivering livestock and food from Rhode Island and bringing back molasses and rum, and also transported slaves from Africa. On the home front James had a chocolate mill and a rum distillery. This James, grandson of John who emigrated with his father in his youth, died in <a href="./1739.html">1739</a>, leaving five sons ranging in age from one to fifteen years. The oldest, James, died in <a href="./1750.html">1750</a>. The other four were Nicholas, Joseph, John, and Moses, who are called the “ldquo;four brothers”rdquo; (or sometimes, “ldquo;John and Josie, Nick and Mosie”rdquo;.) In time the four brothers joined their uncle Obadiah in the family business. After Obadiah’s death the brothers formed Nicholas Brown &amp; Company. Their ventures included the founding of the Hope Furnace for production of pig iron and large scale importation of British goods.</p><p>William G. Roelker described other accomplishments of the Browns, “ldquo;In <a href="./1773.html">1773</a>, also with the aid of a lottery, they built the Market House. ... In <a href="./1775.html">1775</a>-76, they had contracts with the Secret Committee to cast cannon at the Hope Furnace. From <a href="./1775.html">1775</a> to <a href="./1796.html">1796</a>, John Brown was <a href="./Treasurer.html">Treasurer</a> of the College. In <a href="./1783.html">1783</a>, he offered half of the sum for Philosophical Apparatus and the <a href="./Library.html">Library</a>. ...

In <a href="./1786.html">1786</a>, John commenced building his ‘Red-Brick-Mansion-on-the-Hill.’ In <a href="./1787.html">1787</a> he sent the first ship from Narragansett Bay to China, his General Washington. In <a href="./1790.html">1790</a>, Moses induced Samuel Slater to come to Rhode Island to start cotton manufacturing. In <a href="./1791.html">1791</a>, John and Moses founded the Providence Bank.

A number of the Brown family attended the University, among them Nicholas Brown <a href="./1786.html">1786</a>, for whom the college was named in <a href="./1804.html">1804</a>, and his brother, Moses Brown <a href="./1790.html">1790</a>, who died in <a href="./1791.html">1791</a>. They were the sons of Nicholas Brown, <a href="./1729.html">1729</a>-<a href="./1791.html">1791</a>, treasurer, builder and benefactor of the College.

At the age of twelve he was already over six feet tall. He began his connection with the University early. In December <a href="./1903.html">1903</a> he participated in the laying of the cornerstone of the <a href="./John Nicholas Brown Gate.html">John Nicholas Brown Gate</a> in memory of his father, John Nicholas Brown.

Later in life he attended their class reunions and posed again in <a href="./1955.html">1955</a> with them. John Nicholas Brown went to Harvard, but continued his association with Brown as a Trustee from <a href="./1930.html">1930</a> to <a href="./1935.html">1935</a>, when he became a Fellow, and as Secretary of the <a href="./Corporation.html">Corporation</a> from <a href="./1963.html">1963</a> to <a href="./1971.html">1971</a>. His wife, Anne S. K. Brown, donated her extensive military collection to the University. (That collection is on display at the <a href="./Hay, John.html">John Hay</a> <a href="./Library.html">Library</a>.) John Nicholas and Anne Brown had three children. Their first son, Capt.
