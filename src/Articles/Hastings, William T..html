Hastings <a href="./1876.html">1876</a>, who had not planned to go to college at all, but had been persuaded by his principal at Suffield Academy, who was E. Benjamin Andrews <a href="./1870.html">1870</a>, later president of Brown. William Hastings graduated in <a href="./1903.html">1903</a>, and immediately began what was to be his life-long teaching career at Brown, being appointed assistant in <a href="./English.html">English</a> in <a href="./1903.html">1903</a>, instructor in <a href="./1907.html">1907</a>, assistant professor in <a href="./1912.html">1912</a>, associate professor in <a href="./1923.html">1923</a>, professor in <a href="./1935.html">1935</a>, and chairman of the Department of <a href="./English.html">English</a> from <a href="./1937.html">1937</a> to <a href="./1949.html">1949</a>. He earned a master of arts degree at Brown in <a href="./1905.html">1905</a> and a second master of arts degree at Harvard in <a href="./1907.html">1907</a>.

His two greatest interests were Shakespeare (he spelled it “Shakspere") and <a href="./Phi Beta Kappa.html">Phi Beta Kappa</a>. Elected to <a href="./Phi Beta Kappa.html">Phi Beta Kappa</a> in <a href="./1902.html">1902</a>, he was secretary of Rhode Island Alpha from <a href="./1920.html">1920</a> to <a href="./1951.html">1951</a>, vice-president from <a href="./1951.html">1951</a> to <a href="./1953.html">1953</a>, president from <a href="./1953.html">1953</a> to <a href="./1955.html">1955</a>, and chapter historian until his death.

The purity of the <a href="./English.html">English</a> language was important to Hastings and the tendency toward the use of poor <a href="./English.html">English</a> disturbed him. He wrote, “No one acquires the command of good <a href="./English.html">English</a> without effort, but a person of strong intelligence, character and personality has a sizeable advantage of those less fortunately endowed.” His wife, Hester Mercer Hastings ’03 was housemother at the <a href="./Slater Memorial Homestead.html">Slater Memorial Homestead</a>. His two daughters followed academic careers, Hester Hastings ’31 as professor of modern languages at Randolph-Macon Women’s College and Elizabeth Thomson Hastings ’34 as professor of <a href="./English.html">English</a> and dean at Case Western Reserve University.
