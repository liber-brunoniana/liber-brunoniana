Parents and students in vast numbers sought his counsel and help and never in vain. His genius for expressing the warmth of his heart made him the best-beloved Brown man anywhere. ... he knew more alumni and more citizens than any other officer and he put all his knowledge to the service of his alma mater.... He will hold a unique place in the development of Brown, as in the hearts of his host of friends.”rdquo;</blockquote>
