Hersey award, which continued to be given annually by the American Society of Engineers for “outstanding and continued contributions to the field of lubrication science and engineering.” He was awarded the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Medal for <a href="./1967.html">1967</a>. In <a href="./1974.html">1974</a>, in recognition of his life’s work in tribology and its significance in alleviating the energy shortage, he was awarded a gold medal by a group of British engineering societies. Hersey, age 88, accepted the honor only on the condition that no travel would be involved. He was informed that he need not come to England and was offered instead a presentation ceremony in Washington.
