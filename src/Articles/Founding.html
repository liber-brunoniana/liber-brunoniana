<p>The Founding of the College was initiated by the Baptists of the Philadelphia Association. The Association had in <a href="./1756.html">1756</a> established the first Baptist Latin Grammar School, <a href="./Hopewell Academy.html">Hopewell Academy</a>, in New Jersey. In <a href="./1762.html">1762</a>, the design of establishing a college was promoted, with the Reverend <a href="./Edwards, Morgan.html">Morgan Edwards</a>, moderator of the Association a prime mover of the project, and Rhode Island was selected as a likely site, since the colony had been settled by Baptists, was still largely governed by Baptists, and had no college. Accordingly, <a href="./Manning, James.html">James Manning</a>, a graduate of New Jersey College (Princeton) in <a href="./1762.html">1762</a>, visited Newport in July <a href="./1763.html">1763</a>, where he met with “about 15 gentlemen of the same denomination” at the home of Deputy Governor John Gardner. The plan for a college was immediately accepted and a <a href="./Charter.html">Charter</a> was presented to the August <a href="./1763.html">1763</a> General Assembly in Newport. After postponement a different charter was presented at subsequent sessions and granted at the session in East Greenwich on March 2 and 3, <a href="./1764.html">1764</a>. At the first meeting of the <a href="./Corporation.html">Corporation</a> September 5, <a href="./1764.html">1764</a> there were present eleven of the twelve Fellows and nineteen of the 36 Trustees. They included Governor <a href="./Hopkins, Stephen.html">Stephen Hopkins</a>, his rival and sometimes Governor Samuel Ward, and two later governors of Rhode Island, Joseph Wanton and Josias Lyndon. Also present were James Honyman, attorney-general for the Colony, and present and future judges Job Bennet, Joshua Babcock and David Jenckes. There were two Harvard graduates, Edward Upham, who was pastor of the <a href="./First Baptist Church.html">First Baptist Church</a> in Newport, and Jeremiah Condy, a Baptist minister in Boston, and one Yale graduate, Thomas Eyres, a Newport physician. Nicholas Brown, prominent merchant from Providence, for whose son the College would later be named, was also present at the first meeting. The second meeting of the <a href="./Corporation.html">Corporation</a> was held one year later, on September 5, <a href="./1765.html">1765</a>. At this time <a href="./Manning, James.html">James Manning</a> was appointed “<a href="./President.html">President</a> of the College, Professor of Languages and other Branches of Learning ...” just in time to begin his duties, for the first student, <a href="./Rogers, William.html">William Rogers</a>, had matriculated the day before the meeting.</p>
