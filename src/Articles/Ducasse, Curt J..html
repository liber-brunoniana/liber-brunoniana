He thought that the idea of reincarnation made sense, stating that, given the genius and the boob, the beautiful and the ugly, it would be a manifestation of justice in the universe. He said that the study of the paranormal “ldquo;broadened my horizon of the potentialities of human nature and of the universe. So many people are hemmed in by tacit beliefs and disbeliefs, by conformities and the things they take for granted, that they shut their eyes to the fact that the material world is not the whole of this world and that there are apparently dimensions of nature as yet unknown and unexplored. ... I face the prospect of dying as an interesting adventure, as a sort of laboratory experiment.”rdquo; Ducasse died on September 3, <a href="./1969.html">1969</a> at the age of 88. His ashes were buried in the yard next to Chichibu.</p>
