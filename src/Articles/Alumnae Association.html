<p>The Alumnae Association began in <a href="./1900.html">1900</a>, when by invitation of the Class of <a href="./1899.html">1899</a> of the Women’s College the first association of women graduates of Brown was formed and named the Andrews Association in honor of E. Benjamin Andrews. Charlotte Tillinghast <a href="./1896.html">1896</a> was elected temporary president, and the next year became the first president of the permanent organization. In <a href="./1906.html">1906</a>, when the <a href="./Corporation.html">Corporation</a> provided for alumnae representation on the Advisory Council for the Women’s College, the Andrews Association with its voluntary membership became the all-inclusive Alumnae Association of Brown University. In <a href="./1914.html">1914</a> the Alumnae Association was admitted to membership in the Association of Collegiate Alumnae. In <a href="./1909.html">1909</a> Boston and New York alumnae clubs were formed, followed by a Connecticut Valley club, and a Washington club. The Providence Club was formed in <a href="./1923.html">1923</a> and immediately subscribed $<a href="./5000.html">5000</a> for the building of <a href="./Alumnae Hall.html">Alumnae Hall</a>. The alumnae clubs held social meetings, invited speakers, formed reading groups, and sponsored teas for prospective students. In <a href="./1952.html">1952</a> the New York and Providence clubs changed their names from Brown Alumnae Club to <a href="./Pembroke College.html">Pembroke College</a> Club. After the merger of <a href="./Pembroke College.html">Pembroke College</a> with Brown University in <a href="./1971.html">1971</a>, the alumnae clubs began to merge with the Brown Clubs.</p><p>There was a separate alumnae meeting at <a href="./Commencement.html">Commencement</a> for the first time in <a href="./1933.html">1933</a>, which took place at the same time as the meeting of alumni. The <a href="./Dean.html">Dean</a> reported, “<a href="./Alumnae Hall.html">Alumnae Hall</a> was crowded with alumnae, the seniors and their families, and many friends of the College. Miss Eva LeGallienne ... delivered a stimulating address. The occasion was not only significant in itself, but it fittingly symbolized the growing importance and independence of the Alumnae Association of Brown University.” The Alumnae Fund had at that time been in operation for more than two years and had raised $15,000 and offered two scholarships for entering freshmen. Among the executive secretaries of the Association were Elizabeth L. Young ’24 from <a href="./1927.html">1927</a> to <a href="./1929.html">1929</a>, Gertrude Allen McConnell ’10 from <a href="./1929.html">1929</a> to <a href="./1955.html">1955</a>, Doris Hopkins Stapelton ’28 from <a href="./1955.html">1955</a> to <a href="./1972.html">1972</a>, and Mary Louise Reece Barksdale ’51 in <a href="./1972.html">1972</a>-73.
