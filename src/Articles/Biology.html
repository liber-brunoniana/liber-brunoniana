<p>Biology was part of the curriculum during the existence of the early medical school from <a href="articles/1811.html">1811</a> to <a href="articles/1827.html">1827</a>, when undergraduates were admitted to the lectures in anatomy, chemistry, and botany. The importance of these studies was borne out in one of Dr. <a href="articles/Parsons, Usher.html">Usher Parsons</a>’ introductory lectures which was published as “The Importance of the Science of Anatomy and Physiology as a Branch of General <a href="articles/Education.html">Education</a>.” When the medical program ended and its professors departed, <a href="articles/President.html">President</a> <a href="articles/Wayland, Francis.html">Francis Wayland</a>, who had studied medicine, undertook to continue the courses by delivering lectures in natural history in <a href="articles/1828.html">1828</a> and in anatomy and physiology in <a href="articles/1829.html">1829</a>-30. He seems to have discontinued this practice, and chose instead to turn the scientific courses over to <a href="articles/Chace, George Ide.html">George Ide Chace</a>. Chace, who had been teaching natural philosophy and chemistry, was sent to Philadelphia to attend lectures, and in <a href="articles/1836.html">1836</a> was appointed professor of chemistry, physiology, and geology. Chace’s physiology course was described in the laws of <a href="articles/1850.html">1850</a>, “In the course in Physiology it will be the design of the Professor to teach the classifications of the animal and vegetable kingdom, the most important modifications of organized structure, and the laws to which animal and vegetable life is subjected, with special reference to the subjects of health and regimen.” With limited facilities for demonstrations, he conducted his courses by lectures which were dictated slowly so that the students might take them down verbatim. Chace kept in touch with leading scientists and introduced Agassiz and Gould’s <i>Principles of Zoology</i> as a textbook for his course in <a href="articles/1849.html">1849</a>, the year after its publication. After <a href="articles/1850.html">1850</a> he offered an advanced course for those “who may desire to pursue the science by the aid of the knife and microscope.” Dr. <a href="articles/Parsons, Charles W..html">Charles W. Parsons</a>, in an article on the early Brown medical school, observed of Chace’s courses in chemistry, physiology, and geology, that “the instruction in these sciences has been adapted to academic, not to medical, students.”</p><p>The physiology course was taught from <a href="articles/1863.html">1863</a> to <a href="articles/1865.html">1865</a> by <a href="articles/Hill, Nathaniel P..html">Nathaniel P. Hill</a>, who continued to deliver the lectures prepared by Chace. In <a href="articles/1865.html">1865</a> Dr. Parsons began teaching the course, apparently by some informal arrangement at first, as he was formally appointed “Lecturer in Physiology” only in <a href="articles/1867.html">1867</a>, when Chace became acting president. In his first year as professor, Parsons reported that he gave seven lectures in animal classification, 41 lectures in human and comparative anatomy and physiology, seven lectures in vegetable physiology and classification, and five newly introduced lectures on hygiene, a course too wide in range and superficial for his taste. Not receiving a permanent appointment, Parsons left in <a href="articles/1870.html">1870</a>, at which time the physiology course was simply added to the duties of the new professor of physics, <a href="articles/Blake, Eli Whitney.html">Eli Whitney Blake</a>. With an appropriation of 25 dollars from the <a href="articles/Library.html">Library</a> Committee Blake purchased models of the eye, the ear, and the articulations of the hand to aid in his instruction. In <a href="articles/1875.html">1875</a>, under <a href="articles/President.html">President</a> Robinson, a separate professorship of physiology was established and Parsons returned to that position.</p><p>The appointments of John Whipple Potter Jenks as professor of agricultural zoology in <a href="articles/1874.html">1874</a> in accordance with the requirements of the Morrill Act, of <a href="articles/Bailey, William Whitman.html">William Whitman Bailey</a> as instructor in botany in <a href="articles/1877.html">1877</a>, and of Alpheus Spring Packard as professor of zoology and geology in <a href="articles/1878.html">1878</a> made it possible for Parsons finally to devote his course to human anatomy and physiology. In <a href="articles/1882.html">1882</a> Parsons resigned because of his health, and <a href="articles/Chapin, Charles V..html">Charles V. Chapin</a> was appointed in his place. Chapin’s course at first was taught in the junior year, but in <a href="articles/1885.html">1885</a> was shortened to two hours per week and offered to sophomores, whose lack of preparation in chemistry and physics disturbed Chapin, as did the short time allotted. When Chapin was ill during the second term of <a href="articles/1884.html">1884</a>-85, Dr. George Frederic Keene <a href="articles/1875.html">1875</a> took over the physiology course. In <a href="articles/1889.html">1889</a> the course was restored to the junior year, and after <a href="articles/Delabarre, Edmund B..html">Edmund B. Delabarre</a> began to teach psychology in <a href="articles/1892.html">1892</a>, Chapin was able to drop the teaching of the nervous system. His title was “Professor of Physiology and Director of Physical Culture” and he reported on gymnastics and sports. He was ill in <a href="articles/1892.html">1892</a>-93, and after his return the physical culture title was dropped. He continued to teach until <a href="articles/1895.html">1895</a>, but observed that the course, which had been intended as an elementary course in human anatomy and physiology was now elected chiefly by students intending to study medicine, and recommended that “the time has come to drop ‘Physiology,’ in the meaning that it has had in the past from the curriculum, and to strengthen the department of general biology.”</p><p>Alpheus Spring Packard joined the department in <a href="articles/1878.html">1878</a> and taught electives in zoology and geology. In <a href="articles/1882.html">1882</a> a laboratory was set up in the basement of <a href="articles/Rhode Island Hall.html">Rhode Island Hall</a>, a place which turned out to be cold and damp and was replaced three years later by a large and well lighted room upstairs in <a href="articles/Rhode Island Hall.html">Rhode Island Hall</a> adjacent to the museum. The department was radically changed by the arrival in <a href="articles/1890.html">1890</a> of <a href="articles/Bumpus, Hermon Carey.html">Hermon Carey Bumpus</a> as assistant professor of zoology. He took charge of the zoological laboratory and freed Professor Packard to pursue his interest in anthropology and to offer a course in that subject as a senior elective. Bumpus brought with him <a href="articles/Mead, Albert D..html">Albert D. Mead</a>, recently graduated from Middlebury College, and he attracted others to the department, including <a href="articles/Walter, Herbert E..html">Herbert E. Walter</a>, who later became professor of biology at Brown. Walter, who was working with a group of Brown students at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratories, had a scholarship to continue study at M.I.T., which he relinquished to come to Brown. Bumpus’ teaching methods as described by Walter were quoted in <i><a href="articles/Bumpus, Hermon Carey.html">Hermon Carey Bumpus</a>; Yankee Naturalist,</i> by his son, <a href="articles/Bumpus, Hermon Carey.html">Hermon Carey Bumpus</a>, Jr. ’12:</p><blockquote>“Dr. Bumpus had collected under his wing a squad of young disciples, whom he immediately put to work studying <i>Invertebrates.</i> I do not remember much about any lectures or textbooks, educational devices which he had little use for, but I do recall that we willingly worked long hours, studying specimens of all sorts at first hand and ranging through the entire library in pursuit of aid and information as we needed it, while Bumpus was everywhere, helping us to help ourselves.... Early in the 2nd term he appeared one day before us with a brand new copy of W. N. Parker’s translation of Wiedersheim’s <i>Comparative Anatomy of the Vertebrates,</i> which had just been published. He proceeded dramatically to rip off the covers of this new book and to tear it apart into eight approximately equal sections. To each one of us he passed out one of these fragments and told us that we would be held responsible for making plain to the others everything therein contained.... How we went at it, making our own charts, dissections, microscopic slides, demonstrations, and ‘lectures’! Bumpus was constantly at our elbows with suggestions and criticisms, constructive and destructive. Any available material at hand he freely turned over to us. I later much regretted that Tower and I, with his permission, mangled a $35 museum specimen of the rare New Zealand lizard, <i>Sphenodon,</i> in futile dissection.”</blockquote><a href="articles/Gorham, Frederic P..html">Frederic P. Gorham</a> joined the department in <a href="articles/1893.html">1893</a> and introduced the study of bacteriology. When Bumpus went abroad in <a href="articles/1893.html">1893</a>, George W. Field <a href="articles/1887.html">1887</a>, who had recently received his Ph.D. degree from Johns Hopkins, was appointed to take his place with the title of Associate Professor of Cellular Biology. In <a href="articles/1895.html">1895</a> <a href="articles/Mead, Albert D..html">Albert Mead</a> returned with his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, and was appointed instructor in comparative anatomy. The next year it was not possible to keep both Mead and Field. Consequently, <a href="articles/President.html">President</a> Andrews announced Field’s withdrawal “in consequence of our straitened financial situation,” and Mead was named associate professor of embryology and neurology. Field went to Rhode Island College of Agriculture as professor of zoology and biologist in the Agricultural Experiment Station.<p>In the spring vacation of <a href="articles/1897.html">1897</a> the steamer “John M. Long” was chartered to survey the waters of Narragansett Bay, and the students collected marine animals for the museum. Ten students spent the spring vacation at the Biological Station at Woods Hole. The men students that year contributed fifty dollars that year to support the University Table at the Zoological Station in Naples, and the women students earned an equal amount to support a Women’s Table there. The appointment of Bumpus in <a href="articles/1897.html">1897</a> to the Rhode Island Inland Fish Commission and in <a href="articles/1898.html">1898</a> as director of research of the Woods Hole station of the U. S. Fish Commission began an involvement of the Biology Department in the study of the protection of young lobsters. When Bumpus left for the American <a href="articles/Museum of Natural History.html">Museum of Natural History</a>, Professor <a href="articles/Mead, Albert D..html">Albert D. Mead</a> took over his appointment on the Fish Commission. A new floating laboratory at Wickford contributed to the success of the lobster hatchery, cutting the time needed for development to the fourth stage at which independent living is possible nearly in half. To raise the young fry required the deployment of the work force at the laboratory in continuous shifts to keep water in the bags stirred without interruption. A great improvement in this situation occurred when Mead, observing a rotating fan over a restaurant table, set graduate student George H. Sherwood (later director of the American <a href="articles/Museum of Natural History.html">Museum of Natural History</a>) to work on the design of a similar apparatus which lifted and agitated the water in the bags. One of the graduate students, Ernest W. Barnes, was named assistant superintendent of the Wickford Laboratory in <a href="articles/1903.html">1903</a> and became superintendent in <a href="articles/1906.html">1906</a>. In <a href="articles/1935.html">1935</a> the Commission of Inland Fisheries was discontinued. The lobster hatchery suffered damage in the hurricanes of <a href="articles/1938.html">1938</a> and <a href="articles/1944.html">1944</a>, and the work there was discontinued.</p><p>Biology courses for women students were traditionally taught by a woman, beginning with Ada Wing, who was appointed instructor in <a href="articles/1896.html">1896</a> and later named assistant professor of physiology and sanitary science. Instruction for women also included a course in hygiene and home sanitation which involved visits to hospitals. Miss Wing resigned in <a href="articles/1901.html">1901</a> and married professor <a href="articles/Mead, Albert D..html">Albert D. Mead</a>. Marion L. Shorey was instructor in physiology and household economics from <a href="articles/1904.html">1904</a> to <a href="articles/1906.html">1906</a>, as was Alice W. Wilcox from <a href="articles/1906.html">1906</a> to <a href="articles/1913.html">1913</a>. Florence H. Danielson, assistant in biology from <a href="articles/1909.html">1909</a> to <a href="articles/1916.html">1916</a>, was followed by Helen B.

A bequest of $50,000 established the Robert P. Brown Professorship in Biology in <a href="articles/1923.html">1923</a>, and Albert Davis Mead was its first incumbent. Dr. Wilfred Pickles, a physician, was part of the department from <a href="articles/1925.html">1925</a> to <a href="articles/1944.html">1944</a>.

In <a href="articles/1915.html">1915</a> the department moved out of <a href="articles/Rhode Island Hall.html">Rhode Island Hall</a> into the new <a href="articles/Arnold Laboratory.html">Arnold Laboratory</a> built especially for biology. The building was adequate for its time, providing quarters for four professors, Mead amd Walter on the second floor, Gorham and Mitchell on the third, and, on the first floor, the office and laboratory of the woman instructor who taught elementary biology to students at the Women’s College. After J. Walter Wilson ’18, and Charles Arthur Stuart ’21 joined the faculty, more space was provided by the building of a penthouse. In the late 1920s, when the space problem was again critical, the house at 91 Waterman Street was acquired, and was equipped with electricity and plumbing with funds which Dr. Herman C. Pitts had obtained to promote cancer research. The building provided room for graduate students, one classroom, and a laboratory for experimental cytology. With a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation the basement was improved to provide animal quarters. When Psi Upsilon fraternity moved out of its house at 15 Manning Street, the building was renamed <a href="articles/Angell Hall.html">Angell Hall</a> and made into a laboratory for elementary biology, freeing up space in <a href="articles/Arnold Laboratory.html">Arnold Laboratory</a>. With a grant from the National Cancer Institute the house at Brown and Waterman Street, a bequest of Dr. Herbert Partridge <a href="articles/1892.html">1892</a>, was converted into a laboratory named Partridge Hall. When <a href="articles/Psychology.html">Psychology</a> moved out of <a href="articles/Walter Hall.html">Walter Hall</a> at 80 Waterman Street, this building also became a laboratory with the help of matching funds from the Health Research Facilities program of the United States Public Health Service. All of these arrangements helped to provide space for the ever expanding biology program, but only temporarily. A new building, designed by Conrad Green ’36 of Robinson, Green and Beretta, to house the laboratories of Biochemistry, Physiology, Microbiology, and Plant Physiology, was opened in <a href="articles/1962.html">1962</a> and named for J. Walter Wilson.</p><p>In <a href="articles/1989.html">1989</a> a one-million dollar grant was received from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and assigned to such purposes as thematic biology courses, summer research by Brown undergraduates and minority students from other colleges, sabbatic leave programs for secondary-school teachers, student-faculty collaboration, and upgrading equipment. The program in biology consists of the Section of Artificial Organs, Biomaterials and Cellular Technology, The Section of Molecular and Biochemical Pharmacology, the Section of Biochemistry, the Section of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology, the Section of Neurobiology, the Section of Physiology, and the Section of Population Biology, Morphology, and Genetics.
