<p>Degrees were conferred for the first time in <a href="articles/1769.html">1769</a>, when seven Bachelor of Arts degrees were granted to students who had completed the prescribed course, along with twenty-one honorary Master of Arts degrees. The early laws of the college also provided that “All such as shall have applied themselves to their Studies, or any honourable profession in Life for the space of three years from the time of their taking their first Degree, and have been guilty of no gross crime, may expect to receive the honour of a second degree, provided they apply for it one week before <a href="articles/Commencement.html">Commencement</a>.” The next law provided that every candidate for a degree pay the <a href="articles/President.html">President</a> four dollars. In <a href="articles/1772.html">1772</a> six of the seven graduates of <a href="articles/1769.html">1769</a> were awarded Master of Arts degrees. The Bachelor of Arts degree continued to be the only earned degree until the advent of <a href="articles/Wayland, Francis.html">Francis Wayland</a>’s “New System” in <a href="articles/1850.html">1850</a>, which inaugurated the Bachelor of <a href="articles/Philosophy.html">Philosophy</a> for those who desired to prepare themselves for the professions, but were unable to pursue a full course of liberal education. Three groups of courses led to the A.B. degree, ranging from a maximum of ancient languages and mathematics to a maximum of miscellaneous courses with one of the ancient languages replaced by a modern language. The course for the Bachelor of <a href="articles/Philosophy.html">Philosophy</a> was composed of modern languages, mathematics and miscellaneous subjects. Both of these degrees required “an amount of study which <i>may</i> be accomplished in three years, but which may, if he pleases occupy the student profitably for four years.” The Master of Arts was now an undergraduate degree which could be obtained in four years, the requirements for which were practically the same as those formerly prescribed for the Bachelor of Arts. The first Ph.B. degree was awarded to <a href="articles/Tefft, Thomas A..html">Thomas Tefft</a> in <a href="articles/1851.html">1851</a>. In <a href="articles/1857.html">1857</a> the undergraduate Master of Arts degree was dropped, and the Bachelor of Arts was once more a four-year degree.</p><p>The Bachelor of <a href="articles/Philosophy.html">Philosophy</a> degree came under fire in <a href="articles/President.html">President</a> Robinson’s report for <a href="articles/1875.html">1875</a>. Noting that “It is not surprising that young men who are ambitious of the honor of graduation, but are incapable of appreciating the difference in the educations of which the two degrees are intended to be the index, should select that which is most easily obtained; and thus entering college with low aims, should leave it with still lower attainments,” he went on to complain of the “mischievous influence” on the candidates for the Bachelor of Arts degree, who, failing in that endeavor, find that “a shorter and easier way to graduation is still open to their option.” After <a href="articles/1876.html">1876</a> requirements for the Bachelor of <a href="articles/Philosophy.html">Philosophy</a> degree were altered to include four years of study and some knowledge of Latin. In <a href="articles/1911.html">1911</a> further changes required students for the Ph.B. degree to take a course in classical civilization and a course in general biology and to choose a “major” at the end of the sophomore year. There was also an elective choice between “argumentation” and mathematics, which made mathematics no longer compulsory, because of the “unfair burden put upon students who have no natural aptitude for mathematics.” Members of the Class of <a href="articles/1938.html">1938</a> were the last to receive the Ph.B. degree.</p><p><a href="articles/President.html">President</a> Robinson noted in his <i>Autobiography,</i> “It had been decided ... to discontinue the practice handed down from time immemorial of conferring the degree of “A.M.” in course upon graduates of three years’ standing, who might choose, on payment of a fee, to apply for it. The degree was supposed to be conferred on students who had been during the three years engaged in some regular course of study; and in the earlier days, when every student, immediately after graduation, entered a school of law, theology, or medicine, the degree was not unworthily conferred. But when men came to apply for it who had been engaged in no study, professional or other, the degree was in danger of losing all its significance.” The new requirement for the A.M. degree called for an examination on a required number of studies, and led to the establishment of organized graduate study at Brown. The first earned graduate Master of Arts degrees were awarded to Austen K. DeBlois and George Grafton Wilson <a href="articles/1886.html">1886</a> in <a href="articles/1888.html">1888</a>. The same two gentlemen received the first Doctor of <a href="articles/Philosophy.html">Philosophy</a> degree awarded by Brown in <a href="articles/1889.html">1889</a>.</p><p>A course leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science was drawn up in <a href="articles/1891.html">1891</a>, and the Sc.B. degree was awarded for the first time in <a href="articles/1897.html">1897</a> to three candidates. The first degree of Civil Engineer was awarded in <a href="articles/1892.html">1892</a>, and the first degree of Mechanical Engineer in <a href="articles/1896.html">1896</a>. After <a href="articles/1905.html">1905</a> the C.E. and M.E. degrees were changed to the degrees of bachelor of science in civil engineering and in mechanical engineering, and a new degree of bachelor of science in electrical engineering was added. The Master of Science degree was first awarded in <a href="articles/1905.html">1905</a> to Warren A. Clough <a href="articles/1904.html">1904</a> and George B. Obear. With the establishment of the School of <a href="articles/Education.html">Education</a> in <a href="articles/1916.html">1916</a>, the degree of Bachelor of <a href="articles/Education.html">Education</a> was introduced. Requirements for the degree were two years of work, which would include a courses in the following subjects 𔂿  <a href="articles/English.html">English</a>, science or mathematics, literature, history, one of the social studies, philosophy, and education. A limited number of extension courses could be presented for credit. The degree of Bachelor of <a href="articles/Education.html">Education</a> was discontinued in <a href="articles/1929.html">1929</a>, with the provision that the degree would be awarded to candidates already enrolled. For a short time in the 1920s Brown awarded a Master of Business Administration degree. Two students earned their M.B.A. degree in <a href="articles/1923.html">1923</a>, one in <a href="articles/1924.html">1924</a>, and two in <a href="articles/1925.html">1925</a>, after which the degree was discontinued. Degrees with distinction were awarded for the first time in June of <a href="articles/1925.html">1925</a>, when 27 bachelors’ degrees <i>cum laude,</i> eighteen <i>magna cum laude,</i> and five <i>summa cum laude,</i> conferred honor upon fifteen per cent of the graduating class. This practice was later discontinued. The Master of Arts in Teaching degree was introduced in <a href="articles/1957.html">1957</a>. Three degrees of Doctor of Arts in Creative Writing were awarded under an experimental program in <a href="articles/1975.html">1975</a>. The Master of Fine Arts degree has been conferred since <a href="articles/1990.html">1990</a>.</p><p>The degrees conferred by the University from its beginning are summarized in a recent <i>Catalogue,</i> “As of May <a href="articles/1991.html">1991</a>, there were enrolled the names of 78,056 graduates, both men and women. Of this number 61,152 had received the Bachelor’s degree; 14,293 had received advanced degrees; 1,246 had received the degree of Doctor of Medicine; 1,382 had received honorary degrees.”</p>
