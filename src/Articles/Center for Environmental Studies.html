Eleven summer interns renovated the building in the summer of <a href="articles/1982.html">1982</a>. The laboratory helps the community by sharing energy-saving experiences and conducting recycling projects. In <a href="articles/1990.html">1990</a> a program called “Brown is Green” was established under a committee of twelve administrators, professors, and students to encourage at Brown the acceptance of responsibility by individuals for the proper use of natural resources.
