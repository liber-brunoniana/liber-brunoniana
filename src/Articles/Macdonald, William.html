He received a bachelor of arts degree from Harvard in <a href="./1892.html">1892</a> and an honorary Ph.D. degree from Union College in <a href="./1895.html">1895</a>. He was professor of history and economics at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in <a href="./1892.html">1892</a>-93 and professor of history and political science at Bowdoin College from <a href="./1893.html">1893</a> to <a href="./1901.html">1901</a>. He came to Brown in <a href="./1901.html">1901</a> as professor of history and was named George L. Littlefield Professor of <a href="./History.html">History</a> in <a href="./1905.html">1905</a>. He was immensely popular with the students who called him “Billy Mac.” For several years he personally conducted courses of lectures on topics in American history for members of the community who subscribed five dollars. Later he taught courses in the extension school. He was on sabbatical leave in France in <a href="./1917.html">1917</a> when he resigned his professorship and became a special foreign correspondent for <i>The Nation</i> in Europe. He was a lecturer on government at the University of California in <a href="./1917.html">1917</a>-18, associate editor of <i>The Nation</i> from <a href="./1918.html">1918</a> to <a href="./1920.html">1920</a>, and later editorial writer for <i>The Freeman,</i> <i>Commercial and Financial Chronicle</i> and <i>The Nation.</i> From <a href="./1924.html">1924</a> to <a href="./1926.html">1926</a> he was visiting lecturer at Yale. His book, <i>Three Centuries of American Democracy</i> was described in a review as “a tale that makes history fascinating, summarizing with skill and balanced judgment the facts and formative influences that have brought our nation to its present development.” A reviewer called a later work, <i>The Menace of Recovery</i> (<a href="./1934.html">1934</a>) “the most sizzling attack which the New Deal has yet received,” and had this to say, “Mr. Macdonald, who in long years of teaching acquired that accent of bland and monumental authority which only American professors and the leading writers of ‘The London Times’ and the Paris ‘Temps’ command, learned in his later years as a radical editor of ‘The Nation’ the rhetoric of denunciation. ... Mr. Macdonald has forgotten neither the art of invective nor the air of authority.” MacDonald died on December 15, <a href="./1938.html">1938</a> in New York City.</p>
