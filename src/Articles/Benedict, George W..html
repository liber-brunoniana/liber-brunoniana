<p>George Wyllys Benedict (<a href="articles/1872.html">1872</a>-<a href="articles/1966.html">1966</a>), professor of <a href="articles/English.html">English</a>, was born in Burlington, Vermont, on January 12, <a href="articles/1872.html">1872</a>. He graduated in <a href="articles/1893.html">1893</a> from the University of Vermont, where his maternal grandfather had been president and his paternal grandfather professor of natural sciences and acting president. He taught at Phillips Andover Academy, and in <a href="articles/1895.html">1895</a>-96 studied at the University of Freiburg with German philologists Kluge and Thurneysen. He received his master’s degree from Harvard in <a href="articles/1897.html">1897</a> and his Ph.D., also from Harvard, in <a href="articles/1899.html">1899</a>, his dissertation being a study of Sir Kay, seneschal of King Arthur’s court. In <a href="articles/1899.html">1899</a> he came to Brown as an instructor, advancing to assistant professor in <a href="articles/1901.html">1901</a>, associate professor in <a href="articles/1906.html">1906</a>, and full professor in <a href="articles/1923.html">1923</a>. He taught <a href="articles/English.html">English</a> composition, Anglo-Saxon, Chaucer, medieval literature, Shakespeare, and the literature of the Romantic and the Victorian periods. He had another very different talent. He was an expert machinist, and in <a href="articles/1917.html">1917</a> he worked for Builders Iron Foundry, which made marine engines for the Emergency Shipbuilding <a href="articles/Corporation.html">Corporation</a>. During <a href="articles/World War II.html">World War II</a>, in his 70s, he was back at work again, this time turning out firing mechanisms and small precision parts for the Scott Instrument Company. In fact, as Professor <a href="articles/Kapstein, I. J..html">I. J. Kapstein</a> pointed out in his memorial minute for the faculty records, Benedict “was no less than a worshiper of the <a href="articles/English.html">English</a> language as a precision instrument ... he kept a wakeful vigil in behalf of what he worshiped, and students and colleagues alike in our communication with him, whether it was oral or written, trembled to hear his correction of a careless or infelicitous word or phrase. But there was no harshness, no condescension in his attention to our use of the language – there was always a smile, a touch of humor, to ease the sting of correction.” Benedict retired in <a href="articles/1937.html">1937</a> and died in Providence on February 7, <a href="articles/1966.html">1966</a> at the age of 94.</p>
