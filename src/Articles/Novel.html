<p><i>Novel</i> first appeared in the fall of <a href="./1967.html">1967</a>, created by Edward Bloom, Park Honan, and Mark Spilka, all members of the <a href="./English.html">English</a> Department, who recognized the need for an academic journal to encourage the study of fiction as a genre. Honan suggested that the journal be called <i>Novel.</i> Bloom provided its subtitle, “ldquo;A Forum on Fiction,”rdquo; which emphasizes the purpose of the journal to provide a forum for debate among scholars and to clear what Spilka called in his introduction to the first issue “ldquo;a veritable log-jam of conflicting theories.”rdquo; Honan, given a choice of available post office box numbers for the journal, chose “ldquo;<a href="./1984.html">1984</a>,”rdquo; and the title of the opening announcement by Spilka in the first issue was “ldquo;On Box <a href="./1984.html">1984</a>.”rdquo; When he moved to the University of Birmingham in <a href="./1968.html">1968</a>, Park Honan started a British branch of <i>Novel,</i> and with David Lodge, set up a symposium on the Novel in which “ldquo;nine very active British critics”rdquo; participated at the Stratford Institute at Stratford-on-Avon on December 7 and 8, <a href="./1968.html">1968</a>.
