He studied medicine with his father, at the medical schools in Boston and Philadelphia, and in Paris, and received his M.D. degree from Harvard in <a href="articles/1845.html">1845</a>. In <a href="articles/1848.html">1848</a> he began to practice medicine with his father.

After the resignation of <a href="articles/Hill, Nathaniel P..html">Nathaniel P.

In October <a href="articles/1869.html">1869</a> he wrote to Professor Caswell of his situation, “As the college does not propose to me a permanent appointment, I cannot rightly undertake such an engagement and sacrifice to it my professional business.” He proposed that he might continue teaching if an afternoon class which did not interfere with his medical practice could be arranged.
