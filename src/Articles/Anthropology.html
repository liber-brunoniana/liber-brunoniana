The next year he had nineteen senior students, and reported, “ldquo;As this is the second year in which anthropology has been offered as an elective, and as only one other University in the country offers instruction in this study, the interest in this comparatively new science manifested by the class was gratifying.”rdquo; In <a href="./1898.html">1898</a>, with 32 students in his course, Packard reported the urgent need for anthropological monographs and journals which he could not afford to buy and an important addition of “ldquo;flint implements from the Danish refuse-heaps, comprising stone hammers, celts, lance-heads, knives, etc., received by exchange from the Rhode Island Historical Society.”rdquo; The anthropology course ceased with the death of Packard in <a href="./1905.html">1905</a>.</p><p>With the arrival of Giddings in <a href="./1956.html">1956</a>, the Department of <a href="./Sociology.html">Sociology</a> added courses in human origins, cultural anthropology, and the American Indian.
