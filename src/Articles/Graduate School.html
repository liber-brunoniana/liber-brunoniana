<p>The Graduate School started in <a href="./1927.html">1927</a>, succeeding the Graduate Department which had been in existence since <a href="./1903.html">1903</a>. Through the years alumni had desired graduate instruction and in the late 1870s faculty members had accommodated them. <a href="./President.html">President</a> E. G. Robinson gave philosophy courses, and Professor <a href="./Lincoln, John Larkin.html">John Larkin Lincoln</a> met weekly with a class of fifteen Latin scholars. Robinson himself had stayed on in a rented room in the college after his graduation in <a href="./1838.html">1838</a> in order to study German with Professor <a href="./Hackett, Horatio B..html">Horatio B. Hackett</a>. Starting in <a href="./1859.html">1859</a>-60, most of the annual catalogues carried a list of graduates in residence, although there were no advanced degrees. Robinson, in his <a href="./1881.html">1881</a> report, noted, “ldquo;Individual graduates ... are every year proposing to remain and continue their studies in one direction of another; but the number is not large enough, nor the studies proposed to be pursued of a kind, to warrant at present the organization of a special department.”rdquo; His own post-graduate lectures given in <a href="./1878.html">1878</a>-79 and <a href="./1879.html">1879</a>-80 had been replaced the next year by a course of lectures on a variety of subjects, also open to the public, taught by six faculty members. In <a href="./1887.html">1887</a> study for the degrees of Master of Arts and Doctor of <a href="./Philosophy.html">Philosophy</a> was instituted. The Master of Arts required one year of graduate study in residence or two in absence. The requirements for the Doctor of <a href="./Philosophy.html">Philosophy</a> degree were two years in residence, a knowledge of Latin, French, and German, and a “ldquo;thesis giving evidence of high scholarship and special excellence in the studies pursued.”rdquo; The introduction of the doctorate proposed by <a href="./President.html">President</a> Robinson was met with opposition by two senior members of the faculty, one of whom felt that the faculty should not be burdened with the extra work involved, and the other thought the degree would be cheapened by the course of study which Brown would be able to offer.</p><p>The first graduate degrees were awarded to Austen K. DeBlois and George Grafton Wilson <a href="./1886.html">1886</a>, both of whom received the Master of Arts degree in <a href="./1888.html">1888</a> and the Doctor of <a href="./Philosophy.html">Philosophy</a> degree in <a href="./1889.html">1889</a>, DeBlois in philosophy and psychology and Wilson in history and political science. Wilson taught political and social science at Brown from <a href="./1891.html">1891</a> to <a href="./1910.html">1910</a>, when he became professor of international law at Harvard. DeBlois was president of Shurtleff College and Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary. <a href="./President.html">President</a> Robinson recalled in his <i>Autobiography</i> that the first to receive a Ph.D., Austen K. DeBlois, “ldquo;after an extended and thorough course of reading chiefly in <a href="./Philosophy.html">Philosophy</a>, was subjected to a written examination extending through parts of three days, after which he read to the <a href="./Faculty.html">Faculty</a> a carefully prepared thesis.”rdquo; In <a href="./1889.html">1889</a> <a href="./President.html">President</a> Andrews appointed a committee on graduate students, consisting of <a href="./Williams, Alonzo.html">Alonzo Williams</a>, Alpheus Spring Packard, and Albert G. Harkness. Williams, as chairman, continued throughout his life to manage graduate affairs from his office in the German Seminary in <a href="./Sayles Hall.html">Sayles Hall</a>. By the end of Williams’ service, the committee had grown to ten members. During the administration of Andrews, fifteen Ph.D. degrees were earned. Of these, perhaps through the influence of Williams, six were in German, while no other department had more than one. Also through the efforts of Professor Williams the first graduate fellowship was established in <a href="./1891.html">1891</a> by the Rhode Island Department of Grand Army of the Republic with a fund of $10,000, the income of which was available to assist a graduate student, preferably the descendant of a Union veteran of the <a href="./Civil War.html">Civil War</a>.</p><p>In <a href="./1903.html">1903</a> <a href="./Barus, Carl.html">Carl Barus</a> was appointed dean of the newly established Graduate Department. He ran the department out of his office in <a href="./Wilson Hall.html">Wilson Hall</a> aided by what Professor R. Bruce Lindsay <a href="./1920.html">1920</a> described as “ldquo;a stack of forms with slots for the insertion of names, courses and dates. These forms, when duly filled out, were passed over to a half-time secretary, who was often an advanced undergraduate of what was then known as the Women’s College in Brown University.”rdquo; The Master of Science degree was added in <a href="./1904.html">1904</a>. Work in absentia was abolished in <a href="./1908.html">1908</a>. The State of Rhode Island began in <a href="./1912.html">1912</a>-13 to grant graduate scholarships in education to teachers in service. Over one hundred doctorates were awarded during Barus’ administration from <a href="./1903.html">1903</a> to <a href="./1926.html">1926</a>, in the latter half of which many were in chemistry and biology. In <a href="./1917.html">1917</a>-18 new rules governing graduate education provided that the major department be responsible for seeing that candidates for the master’s degree submit a substantial thesis on an approved topic. After it became apparent that few departments were requiring the thesis, a Graduate Council consisting of four members and the <a href="./Dean.html">Dean</a> was established in <a href="./1922.html">1922</a> to help with the administration of graduate work.</p><p>Barus retired in <a href="./1926.html">1926</a>. Between <a href="./1888.html">1888</a> and <a href="./1926.html">1926</a> the number of degrees conferred amounted to 132 Ph.D. degrees, 1,001 Master of Arts degrees, 98 Master of Science degrees, and 5 Master of Business Administration degrees. In <a href="./1927.html">1927</a> the Graduate School, with Roland G. D. Richardson as dean, replaced the Graduate Department. In that year <a href="./Sharpe, Henry D. 1894.html">Henry D. Sharpe</a> gave five scholarships to the Graduate School for study in biology, <a href="./English.html">English</a>, history, mathematics, and Romance languages. Richardson encouraged doctoral programs in mathematics and physics, especially by the establishment of the Graduate Division of Applied <a href="./Mathematics.html">Mathematics</a> in <a href="./1941.html">1941</a>. The emphasis during Richardson’s administration was on the doctorate. Three hundred and sixty Ph.D degrees were awarded between <a href="./1930.html">1930</a> to <a href="./1950.html">1950</a>, an annual average of eighteen, compared to four per year during Barus’ time. Following <a href="./Dean.html">Dean</a> Richardson, the deans of the Graduate School have been <a href="./Keeney, Barnaby C..html">Barnaby C. Keeney</a> from <a href="./1949.html">1949</a> to <a href="./1953.html">1953</a>, <a href="./Lindsay, Robert Bruce.html">Robert Bruce Lindsay</a> from <a href="./1954.html">1954</a> to <a href="./1966.html">1966</a>, Michael J. Brennan from <a href="./1966.html">1966</a> to <a href="./1974.html">1974</a>, Maurice Glicksman from <a href="./1974.html">1974</a> to <a href="./1976.html">1976</a>, Ernest S. Frerichs from <a href="./1976.html">1976</a> to <a href="./1982.html">1982</a>, Mark B. Schupack from <a href="./1983.html">1983</a> to <a href="./1986.html">1986</a>, and Phillip J. Stiles (as <a href="./Dean.html">Dean</a> of the Graduate School and <a href="./Dean.html">Dean</a> of Research) since <a href="./1986.html">1986</a>. Acting deans were <a href="./Ducasse, Curt J..html">Curt J. Ducasse</a> from <a href="./1947.html">1947</a> to <a href="./1949.html">1949</a>, Edmund S.

The total enrollment of the Graduate School in September <a href="./1991.html">1991</a> was <a href="./1379.html">1379</a>, composed of 816 men and 563 women, of whom 1316 are full-time and 73 were part-time students.</p>
