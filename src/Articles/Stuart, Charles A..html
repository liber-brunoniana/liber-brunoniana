He stayed on to receive his master of science degree in <a href="./1919.html">1919</a> and his Ph.D. in <a href="./1923.html">1923</a>. Appointed instructor in <a href="./1923.html">1923</a>, he was promoted to assistant professor in <a href="./1925.html">1925</a>, associate professor in <a href="./1931.html">1931</a>, and professor in <a href="./1944.html">1944</a>.

He was consulting bacteriologist to the <a href="./Chapin, Charles V..html">Charles V.

His research was related to infectious mononucleosis and the enteric bacteria. His vocation was also his avocation.

The laboratory in the basement of <a href="./Arnold Laboratory.html">Arnold Laboratory</a>, to which he had advanced after his first assignment to the penthouse on top of the building, was his home for the rest of his career.

Formal ’45, writing with Staley Falkow in the <i>Journal of Bacteriology,</i> reminisced about Stuart’s work:</p><blockquote>“ldquo;He made his own media, washed his own glassware, and maintained his own cultures. He shunned technical assistants, and when he required help, Mrs. Stuart was always nearby. ... He was adored by his students and was known to all of them simply as ‘Doc.’”rdquo;</blockquote>
