Friend to all, counsellor to many, inspiring lecturer, recognized authority in your chosen field, internationally respected and revered, it is with deep regret we view your departure from the faculty. Pax vobiscum.”</blockquote>At the <a href="./1937.html">1937</a> <a href="./Commencement.html">Commencement</a> Everett’s portrait by Ernest L.

An obituary notice in the Providence <i>Evening Bulletin</i> recalled Everett:<blockquote>“All the graciousness and courtesy of an Old-World gentleman were expressed in him. ... Small, dapper, twinkling eyes, the sideburns, the cultured voice, the wit, the careful phrasing, the joy he experienced in teaching the subject in which he delighted, the side remarks that carried so much human wisdom. And was there ever such a generous man! Even the dolt, to whom philosophy was as esoteric as the Tibetan mysteries, would receive his encouragement and his kindly words. Small himself in stature, he was as grand in his thought and as magnificent in his feelings as the mighty Himalayas. Once he introduced Bertrand Russell, the distinguished British philosopher, mathematician and radical, to an audience in <a href="./Sayles Hall.html">Sayles Hall</a>. The introductory speech of Professor Everett remains; what Bertrand Russell said is forgotten.”</blockquote>
