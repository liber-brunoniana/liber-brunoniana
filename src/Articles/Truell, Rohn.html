C. He earned a bachelor of science degree in engineering at Lehigh University in <a href="articles/1935.html">1935</a>, and received his Ph.D. degree from Cornell in <a href="articles/1941.html">1941</a>. He was a research physicist from <a href="articles/1942.html">1942</a> to <a href="articles/1944.html">1944</a> at the R.C.A. Laboratories in Princeton, and from <a href="articles/1944.html">1944</a> to <a href="articles/1946.html">1946</a> at Stromberg Carlson Company and Cornell University. In <a href="articles/1946.html">1946</a> he was appointed assistant professor of physics at Brown.  He was promoted to associate professor in <a href="articles/1946.html">1946</a>, and became professor of applied mathematics in <a href="articles/1951.html">1951</a>. He established the Metals Reseach Laboratory in <a href="articles/1948.html">1948</a>, and was chairman of the laboratory until his sudden death in Providence on January 10, <a href="articles/1968.html">1968</a>, following a stroke. The memorial minute of the faculty read:</p><blockquote>“Rohn Truell was a gifted experimentalist, possessed great scientific insight, and was always aware of the interplay between theory and experimentation. He was one of the first to see the feasibility of studying solids by means of ultrasonics and the Metals Research Laboratory which he organized at Brown in <a href="articles/1948.html">1948</a> rapidly became a leading world center in this field of research.”</blockquote>
