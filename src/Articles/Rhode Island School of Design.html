<p>Rhode Island School of Design entered into cooperation with Brown in <a href="articles/1902.html">1902</a>, when three courses at the school were opened to Brown students and counted as qualifications for a degree. School of Design students were admitted to any class at Brown for which they were prepared, and Professor <a href="articles/Poland, William Carey.html">William Carey Poland</a> gave a special course in the history of art for them. The School of Design had been founded in <a href="articles/1877.html">1877</a> by a group of women, including Miss Sarah Doyle, with $1,675 left over from the funds of the Womenâ€™s Centennial Commission of Rhode Island. The coeducational institution for students in art and design fulfilled, at least in part, a wish expressed by <a href="articles/Robinson, Ezekiel Gilman.html">Ezekiel Gilman Robinson</a> in <a href="articles/1873.html">1873</a> that a scientific school should be established in Rhode Island for instruction in drawing, civil engineering, architecture, and fine arts. Robinson had hoped that the school would be connected to Brown University. <a href="articles/Poland, William Carey.html">William Carey Poland</a> was president of the school from <a href="articles/1896.html">1896</a> to <a href="articles/1907.html">1907</a>. Brown students are still entitled to received credit for courses taken at the School of Design.</p>
