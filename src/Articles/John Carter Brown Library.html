<p>The John Carter Brown <a href="./Library.html">Library</a> houses a collection of Americana which John Carter Brown <a href="./1816.html">1816</a> began to collect in <a href="./1846.html">1846</a> when he purchased a small collection of American books from his brother, Nicholas Brown <a href="./1811.html">1811</a>, who was leaving for Rome where he was to be United States Consul General. John Carter Brown had already begun to buy books on travel and history in his student days, and in <a href="./1841.html">1841</a> had inherited the family library from his father. He decided to collect books printed before <a href="./1801.html">1801</a>, which, at the time, was a relatively recent date. He enlisted the aid of Henry Stevens “of Vermont,” a recent Yale graduate and law student, who was willing to travel to Europe in <a href="./1845.html">1845</a> to buy rare books for Brown and other clients. In the next two years his purchases had enlarged Brown’s collection by <a href="./1500.html">1500</a> titles, many of them from the library of Henri Ternaux-Compans. There were a number of other collectors of similar material, notably James Lenox of New York, Brown’s summer neighbor in Newport, who also made use of Stevens’ services and whose collection, (which became the “Lenox <a href="./Library.html">Library</a>”) overtook Brown’s. The importance of Mr. Brown’s private collection is attested by this entry in <i>The Librarian’s Manual</i> in <a href="./1858.html">1858</a>: “These two <a href="./Catalogues.html">Catalogues</a>, (Rich’s Bibliotheca and Supplement), although they contain two thousand five hundred and twenty-three articles, are far from being complete. A merchant in Providence, well known to the amateurs of this class of books, has in his own private collection three thousand two hundred and thirty-one early works upon America, published between the years <a href="./1700.html">1700</a> and <a href="./1800.html">1800</a>, of which one thousand five hundred and twelve are not mentioned by Rich. He has also one thousand one hundred and seventy-four works published <i>previous</i> to the year <a href="./1700.html">1700</a>, of which five hundred and nine are not mentioned by Ternaux; thus making four thousand four hundred and five separate works relating to America and published previous to the year <a href="./1800.html">1800</a>, of which two thousand and twenty-one were unknown to the eminent American bibliographers, whose catalogues are described in this list.”</p><p>John Carter Brown set the geographical boundary of his collection as the entire western hemisphere. His friend and librarian, John Russell Bartlett, encouraged him in collecting works from the presses of Mexico and Peru and works on the Spanish Southwest. In <a href="./1865.html">1865</a> Bartlett prepared an edition of fifty copies of the first part of <i>A Catalogue of Books relating to North and South America in the <a href="./Library.html">Library</a> of John Carter Brown, of Providence, R.I.,</i> which included selected titles of works printed between <a href="./1493.html">1493</a> and <a href="./1600.html">1600</a>. The second part, for the years <a href="./1601.html">1601</a> to <a href="./1700.html">1700</a>, was published in <a href="./1866.html">1866</a>, and the third part, from <a href="./1701.html">1701</a> to <a href="./1800.html">1800</a>, in <a href="./1870.html">1870</a> and <a href="./1871.html">1871</a>. An updated new catalogue with the same subdivisions was issued by his widow between <a href="./1875.html">1875</a> and <a href="./1882.html">1882</a>. After the death of John Carter Brown in <a href="./1874.html">1874</a>, the second printed catalogue of his books, which now numbered about 7,000, was printed in the years <a href="./1875.html">1875</a> to <a href="./1882.html">1882</a>.</p><p>The library was inherited by Brown’s widow, Sophia Augusta Brown, who had her own interests in collecting. She preferred fine printing and manuscripts, and acquired illuminated church manuscripts and Shakespeare folios. One of her two sons, Harold Brown <a href="./1886.html">1886</a>, was more interested in his collection of books on the liturgy of the Church of England and the history of that church in America. The older son, John Nicholas Brown <a href="./1885.html">1885</a>, inherited his father’s interest in Americana, and it was to him that his mother deeded the collection in <a href="./1898.html">1898</a>. John Nicholas had already hired <a href="./Winship, George Parker.html">George Parker Winship</a> in <a href="./1895.html">1895</a> to catalogue the library, and he was also planning to erect a building for the library, when he died on May 1, <a href="./1900.html">1900</a>. He left his books, an endowment of $500,000, and a building fund of $150,000 to be placed by his trustees wherever they thought best. The trustees chose Brown University, and the bequest was received in September <a href="./1901.html">1901</a>. Under an agreement between the trustees of the estate and the University in <a href="./1902.html">1902</a>, the library is owned by the <a href="./Corporation.html">Corporation</a>, but has been operated as a semi-autonomous institution with its own administration and funding, under a committee of management. It receives an annual subsidy from the University, but is not part of the library system. The collections of Sophia Augusta Brown and Harold Brown were also given to Brown.</p><p>The library building was erected on the middle campus near George Street. Two dormitories, Messer House and <a href="./Howell House.html">Howell House</a>, and the rectory of St. Stephen’s Church were razed from the site. The building, designed by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge and built by Norcross Brothers, is entirely of stone, limestone on the outside and sandstone on the inside. The red tile roof is edged by a cheveau of a shell design connected by scrolls carved by stonecutters John Evans and Company of Boston. Carved above the door are the arms of the <a href="./Brown family.html">Brown family</a> and “AMERICANA.” The ceiling of the elegant 75-foot reading room is supported by four Ionic pillars. At the dedication on May 17, <a href="./1904.html">1904</a>, a procession marched through the <a href="./John Nicholas Brown Gate.html">John Nicholas Brown Gate</a>, opened for the first time, and four-year-old John Nicholas Brown presented the keys to the library to <a href="./President.html">President</a> Faunce.</p><p>Winship came to the campus with the <a href="./Library.html">Library</a>, and by the time of his retirement in <a href="./1915.html">1915</a>, the collection had grown to 30,000 volumes. Champlin Burrage, who had been librarian of Manchester College in Oxford was appointed to succeed Winship. Burrage remained only until <a href="./1917.html">1917</a>, and the library was under the care of Worthington C. Ford, until the appointment of <a href="./Wroth, Lawrence C..html">Lawrence C. Wroth</a> in <a href="./1923.html">1923</a>. Wroth was librarian until <a href="./1957.html">1957</a> and was followed by Thomas R. Adams from <a href="./1957.html">1957</a> to <a href="./1983.html">1983</a> and Norman Fiering since <a href="./1983.html">1983</a>.</p><p>In the 1980s, the John Carter Brown <a href="./Library.html">Library</a> became a center for advanced research in the humanities, and started a fellowship program with stipends for scholars from around the world, who come to do research for several months. In the summer of <a href="./1989.html">1989</a> construction began on a four-level annex at the rear of the building, designed by the Washington firm of Hartman-Cox. The addition was named the Caspersen Building, in honor of the parents of benefactor Finn Casperson ’63, and the reading room of the library was named in honor of the family of W. Duncan MacMillan ’53.</p>
