<p><i>Brun Mael</i> was the yearbook of the Women’s College and later of <a href="./Pembroke College.html">Pembroke College</a>. The first edition, which appeared in <a href="./1909.html">1909</a> was a small brown suede covered volume. Its name was derived from the Anglo-Saxon for “Brown Legends,” as loosely translated by the women students who chose the name. Professor <a href="./Benedict, George W..html">George W. Benedict</a> had some reservations about the accuracy of name, which he felt may have suffered in the translation of an Anglo-Saxon word similar to “mael,” which meant “speech,” and from which “blackmail” is a descendant. <a href="./Stillwell, Margaret B..html">Margaret B. Stillwell</a> ’09 was the editor of the first <i>Brun Mael,</i> which contained this little “Prologue,” in script within a frame supported by winged cherubs:</p><blockquote>Deal gently with this little Book,<br /> The first of its Race and Kind;<br /> Remember ’tis but an Infant yet<br /> And to its Faults be blind:<br /> As an Infant, yet an Ancestor,<br /> It starts out in the Strife – <br /> To win for its Posterity<br /> A place in College Life:<br /> Now go little Book out in the World,<br /> In Life’s Struggles to engage,<br /> Someday to review your Descendants there<br /> When you’ve reached a ripe old Age.</blockquote>In the aftermath of the World War there was no <i>Brun Mael</i> published in <a href="./1919.html">1919</a>. That year the <i><a href="./Sepiad.html">Sepiad</a></i> printed a special senior number which included the yearbook information. The photographs of the seniors grew from a little over an inch (accompanied by much text describing the student) to a whole new format in <a href="./1968.html">1968</a>, when large photographs depicted the individual graduates in poses of their choice, which were taken inside and outside, in sunshine and in shade, and occasionally in the rain. The final <i>Brun Mael</i> in <a href="./1970.html">1970</a> had a mirrored cover with the phrase “I FIND (ME printed in reverse) ONLY HERE .” After the merger of <a href="./Pembroke College.html">Pembroke College</a> with Brown University in <a href="./1971.html">1971</a> the <i><a href="./Liber Brunensis.html">Liber Brunensis</a></i> was the yearbook for both men and women students.
