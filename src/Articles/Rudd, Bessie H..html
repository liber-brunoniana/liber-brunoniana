She was a firm believer in the importance of sports for all students and the four-year physical education requirement.

She was widely quoted in newspapers across the country as saying, “Let the women have their sports, and let the men have theirs. I see no reason for ice hockey for women. And I certainly don’t see any reason for football.” She favored compulsory physical education for all four years of college, and disapproved when the requirement was reduced to three years in <a href="./1960.html">1960</a> and later abolished.
