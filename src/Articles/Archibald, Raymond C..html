He graduated from Mount Allison University at the age of eighteen with first class honors in mathematics and a teacher’s diploma in violin. He received a second bachelor’s degree from Harvard in <a href="./1896.html">1896</a>, and a master’s degree in <a href="./1897.html">1897</a>.

He built the library to 12,000 volumes, for which he wrote by hand 30,000 catalogue cards. In <a href="./1907.html">1907</a>-08 he was professor of mathematics at Acadia University. The next year he became instructor in mathematics at Brown. He became assistant professor in <a href="./1911.html">1911</a>, associate professor in <a href="./1917.html">1917</a>, and professor in <a href="./1928.html">1928</a>. He gave up his music to devote himself completely to the teaching of mathematics, which included personal conferences with each of his students every semester, and to the building up of the mathematical library at Brown to one of the most eminent in the country. As Librarian of the American Mathematical Society from <a href="./1921.html">1921</a> to <a href="./1941.html">1941</a> he also supervised the growth of that library. After his retirement in <a href="./1943.html">1943</a>, he collected and presented in honor of his mother the Mary Mellish Memorial <a href="./Library.html">Library</a> of American and <a href="./English.html">English</a> poetry and drama to Mount Allison University. His published works included <i>Carlyle’s First Love, Margaret Gordon, Lady Bannerman</i> in <a href="./1910.html">1910</a>, <i>Euclid’s book On Division of Figures</i> in <a href="./1915.html">1915</a>, <i>A Semicentennial <a href="./History.html">History</a> of the American Mathematical Society, <a href="./1888.html">1888</a>-<a href="./1938.html">1938</a></i> in <a href="./1938.html">1938</a>, and <i>Outline of the <a href="./History.html">History</a> of <a href="./Mathematics.html">Mathematics</a></i> in <a href="./1932.html">1932</a> and five subsequent editions. In <a href="./1939.html">1939</a> he was named chairman of a National Research Council on tables, which led to the founding of a journal, <i>Mathematical Tables and Other Aids to Computation,</i> of which Archibald was editor. He died on July 26, <a href="./1955.html">1955</a>, in Sackville, New Brunswick.</p>
