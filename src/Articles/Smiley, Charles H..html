<p>Charles Hugh Smiley (<a href="./1903.html">1903</a>-<a href="./1977.html">1977</a>), professor of astronomy, was born in Camden, Missouri, on September 6, <a href="./1903.html">1903</a>. He attended the University of California at <a href="./Los.html">Los</a> Angeles and the University of California at Berkeley, graduating with highest honors in mathematics in <a href="./1924.html">1924</a>, and earned his M.A. degree in <a href="./1925.html">1925</a> and his Ph.D. in mathematics in <a href="./1927.html">1927</a> at Berkeley. From <a href="./1927.html">1927</a> to <a href="./1929.html">1929</a> he was an instructor in mathematics at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. He was a Guggenheim fellow in <a href="./1929.html">1929</a>-30, working at the Royal Greenwich Observatory and visiting other European observatories. He was appointed assistant professor of mathematics at Brown in <a href="./1930.html">1930</a> and associate professor of astronomy in <a href="./1938.html">1938</a>, at which time he was also made director of the <a href="./Ladd Observatory.html">Ladd Observatory</a> and chairman of the Department of <a href="./Astronomy.html">Astronomy</a>. He was promoted to full professor in <a href="./1945.html">1945</a>. He led fourteen solar eclipse expeditions, in Peru, Canada, Brazil, Thailand, Pakistan, and the United States. On one occasion in <a href="./1963.html">1963</a> he flew in a U.S. Air Force jet at 48,000 feet, racing the moon’s shadow to view a lunar eclipse longer than any other observer. He also led several expeditions between <a href="./1947.html">1947</a> and <a href="./1952.html">1952</a> to determine the atmospheric refraction at low angular altitudes. In <a href="./1949.html">1949</a> he travelled to Point Barrow, Alaska, on a Navy plane, and later that year flew with an Air Force plane to the true North Pole. He wrote a popular column, “ldquo;Planets and Stars,”rdquo; which appeared in the <i>Providence Journal</i> from <a href="./1938.html">1938</a> to <a href="./1957.html">1957</a>. For many years he studied the Mayan calendar and was able to date the Mayan Codices of Dresden, Paris, and Madrid from astronomical dates which they contained. He was a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and president of the American Association of Variable Star Observers. He was a member of the editorial advisory board of <i>Sky &amp; Telescope</i> from <a href="./1941.html">1941</a> to <a href="./1959.html">1959</a>. Smiley’s wife, the former Margaret Kendall Holbrook, taught astronomy at Wellesley before their marriage. Smiley viewed his last eclipse in Providence in <a href="./1974.html">1974</a>.
