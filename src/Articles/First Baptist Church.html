<p>The First Baptist Church, which has been the scene of Brown commencements since <a href="articles/1776.html">1776</a>, was the first Baptist Church in America. When Roger Williams was banished from Massachusetts for his religious and political beliefs, he came in <a href="articles/1636.html">1636</a> with five others to a place he named Providence. Joined by other Separatists, he became the first pastor of the group of about twelve persons which constituted the Church in <a href="articles/1638.html">1638</a>. In <a href="articles/1771.html">1771</a>, after the removal of the College to Providence, <a href="articles/President.html">President</a> <a href="articles/Manning, James.html">James Manning</a> became pastor of the church, continuing until <a href="articles/1791.html">1791</a>. Other Brown presidents who served as pastor were <a href="articles/Maxcy, Jonathan.html">Jonathan Maxcy</a>, who served for one year, <a href="articles/1791.html">1791</a>-<a href="articles/1792.html">1792</a>, resigning when he became president of the college, and <a href="articles/Wayland, Francis.html">Francis Wayland</a>, who was acting pastor from March <a href="articles/1857.html">1857</a> to June <a href="articles/1858.html">1858</a>.</p><p>Manning was described by Reverend Henry Melville King, a later pastor, as “the first educated pastor since Roger Williams.” It was during his ministry that the Society resolved in February <a href="articles/1774.html">1774</a> to build a meeting-house “for the publick Worship of Almighty GOD; and also for holding <a href="articles/Commencement.html">Commencement</a> in.” The building cost <a href="articles/7000.html">7000</a> pounds, of which <a href="articles/2000.html">2000</a> pounds was raised by a state-authorized lottery. The meeting house was dedicated on May 28, <a href="articles/1775.html">1775</a>. Since <a href="articles/1776.html">1776</a> all Commencements have been held there, except for those of <a href="articles/1804.html">1804</a> and <a href="articles/1832.html">1832</a>.</p>
