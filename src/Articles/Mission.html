If such a formal mission statement were to be adopted today it might look something like:<blockquote>‘Brown is a University-College. It has as its objective the offering of educational programs of the highest quality for undergraduates interested in the liberal arts and sciences and engineering, professional training for students pursuing a career in medicine, and graduate education and training in the arts and sciences, engineering and medicine. Its faculty is devoted to instruction and research and is expected to teach both undergraduate and graduate students. The goal of Brown, its faculty and staff, is to carry out these objectives at the highest level of excellence. Brown seeks to be the best University-College.’”rdquo;</blockquote>
