The very last years of his life he suffered two falls and a critical illness, during which he was accustomed to following the local news bulletins on his condition on television, which he explained was “ldquo;the only way I can find out how I feel.”rdquo; He had been very frail as a child as a result of early illness, but compensated for this by being very athletic, especially in tennis and swimming, into his 80s.</p><p>Green’s loyalty to Brown was legendary. He had lived nearby and attended Brown Commencements from his early childhood until his old age, being absent only while he was a student in Germany.
