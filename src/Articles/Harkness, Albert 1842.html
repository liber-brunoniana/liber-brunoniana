At his death on May 27, <a href="articles/1907.html">1907</a>, the <i>Brown Alumni Monthly</i> printed these lines about him:</p><blockquote>"Professor Harkness was a drill-master of the old school, insistent in accuracy of form and statement, impatient of slovenly preparation or recital. With a pellucid mind himself it sometimes seemed difficult for him to comprehend at the full the difficulties surrounding the undergraduate mind; yet there was never a member of the university faculty more modest in the expression of his own views, more amiable in the face of intellectual challenge of an inferior, more kindly disposed toward anyone, whether student or not, in the time of trouble.<p>"If the typical scholar be, in outward appearance, stern and unbending, Professor Harkness did not conform to the conventional ideal. His brow was clear, and a cheerful light habitually lurked within his penetrating eye. He was neither domineering nor obtrusive; conscious, no doubt of his sure footing in the classics, he was the reverse of voluble; though on appropriate occasions he could maintain his opinions with equal force and firmness, and in formal address he possessed the happy faculty of combining academic tradition with modern frankness of presentation."</p></blockquote>A bronze bust of Harkness modeled by William Manatt of Providence six months before Harkness’s death was given to Brown by his widow in <a href="articles/1909.html">1909</a>.
