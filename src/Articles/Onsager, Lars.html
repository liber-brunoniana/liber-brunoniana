<p>Lars Onsager, (<a href="./1903.html">1903</a>-<a href="./1976.html">1976</a>), instructor in chemistry, was born in Oslo on November 27, <a href="./1903.html">1903</a>. He received a degree from the Norwegian Technical University in <a href="./1925.html">1925</a> and studied at Zurich University before coming to the United States in <a href="./1928.html">1928</a>. In that year, after a brief stint as associate in chemistry at Johns Hopkins University, he came to Brown as research instructor in chemistry and stayed until <a href="./1933.html">1933</a>. He left Brown for Yale, where he was awarded a Ph.D. degree and later became J. Willard Gibbs Professor of Theoretical <a href="./Chemistry.html">Chemistry</a>. In <a href="./1968.html">1968</a> he won the Nobel Prize in <a href="./Chemistry.html">Chemistry</a> for work which he had done at Brown and had published in <a href="./1931.html">1931</a>. His work, described by a colleague as “ldquo;so theoretical that it took 37 years for it be recognized adequately”rdquo; came to be recognized as “ldquo;the fourth law of thermodynamics.”rdquo; Professor <a href="./Gibbs, Julian H..html">Julian Gibbs</a> described the brilliant Onsager as one who always thought that his listeners were as advanced as he was. Students were accustomed to call his course in statistical mechanics “ldquo;sadistical mechanics”rdquo; or “ldquo;Norwegian One.”rdquo; He died on October 2, <a href="./1976.html">1976</a> in Coral Gables, Florida. He was at that time 72 years old and a professor at the University of Miami’s Center for Theoretical Studies. The director of the center called him “ldquo;the greatest theoretical chemist the world has had.”rdquo;</p>
