<p>Track and field events began at Brown in <a href="./1878.html">1878</a>, when the Athletic Association held the first Field Day. The events were a rope pull between the Classes of <a href="./1879.html">1879</a> and <a href="./1880.html">1880</a>, the standing broad jump, the running broad jump, the standing high jump, the running high jump, the shot put, the hundred yards dash, the three-legged race, the wheelbarrow race, and the base ball throw. The spring meet added the five mile run, the quarter-mile run, the hammer throw, the hurdles, a sack race, and a potato race. The New England Intercollegiate Association was organized in <a href="./1887.html">1887</a>, and held its first meet on May 27 of that year. In the <a href="./1890.html">1890</a> meet, Fred Hovey <a href="./1890.html">1890</a> took second in the pole vault and E. A. Barrows <a href="./1891.html">1891</a> won the high jump with five feet five inches.</p><p><a href="./Marvel, Frederick W..html">Frederick Marvel</a> <a href="./1890.html">1890</a> recalled the informality of track practice, “ldquo;Brown students used what was known as the Sanitary Gymnasium on Aborn street, and the more zealous individuals did attain a fair measure of conditioning work for the few and infrequent tests of the time. We ran around the Middle <a href="./Campus.html">Campus</a> in those days when we wanted to practice running, and every man had to make a long or short jump over the wet ground around the pump, according to the size of the area at that particular moment.”rdquo; In March of <a href="./1891.html">1891</a> an indoor meet was held in <a href="./Sayles Hall.html">Sayles Hall</a>, with the Sanitary Gymnasium, the Y.M.C.A., and the Narragansett Boat Club members as participants. Ed Weeks <a href="./1893.html">1893</a> won the 25-yard dash and Everett A. Bowen <a href="./1892.html">1892</a> the 600. Frank Sexton <a href="./1893.html">1893</a> won the mile <i>walk</i> in 8 minutes 8 seconds, and G. N. Richmond <a href="./1892.html">1892</a> won the mile in 5:35. In the big event of the meet, the class relay, Marvel, running anchor for the freshmen, passed senior runner E. A. Barrows in the final stage of the race, flew off at a tangent to the track in the final turn, and knocked <a href="./President.html">President</a> Andrews off his chair at the sidelines. Andrews’ comment to the future athletic director of the University was, “ldquo;Never mind, son, you won the race.”rdquo;</p><p>David C. Hall ’01, captain of the track team for three years, won the New England championship in the mile twice and held the NEAAU ten-mile title for four years. He finished third in the 800-metres in the <a href="./1900.html">1900</a> Olympics. At the New England Intercollegiate Athletic Association annual meet in <a href="./1902.html">1902</a>, Brown came in third of eight colleges after Amherst and Dartmouth, having placed first, second, and third in the two-mile bicycle race and scored in the one- and two-mile runs and the discus throw. In the <a href="./1904.html">1904</a> NEIAA meet, Brown finished third, although for financial reasons only five men went to Worcester. Richard Tucker ’05 won both the mile and the two-mile, and Charles Ehmke ’05 won the discus and was third in the shot put. Also in <a href="./1904.html">1904</a>, Brown held the first of the Brown University Interscholastic Track Association annual meets for area high school and business college athletes. In <a href="./1905.html">1905</a> a new board running track, nine feet wide and about fourteen laps to the mile, occupied the space between the <a href="./Colgate Hoyt Pool.html">Colgate Hoyt Pool</a> and the Thayer Street fence. Brown was second in the <a href="./1906.html">1906</a> NEIAA meet, Tucker again winning the mile and two mile and John Mayhew ’09 the running broad jump. About a week earlier in a meet with Syracuse, Captain Arthur Wright ’06 had won the two-mile, and fell back in the mile to allow Tucker to finish first. A track coach, Hugh C. McGrath, who was a graduate of Boston University, was hired in <a href="./1907.html">1907</a>. That year the team came in second in the New England Intercollegiates through a team effort in which Brown men won points in ten out of fourteen events. McGrath came back again in the spring of <a href="./1909.html">1909</a> after a year’s absence. Track was not a high priority. The <a href="./1910.html">1910</a> <i><a href="./Liber Brunensis.html">Liber Brunensis</a></i> called to mind “ldquo;the same old story that has been told for years about Brown track athletics, – a story which has for its chief and never-ending theme, ‘Lack of money.’”rdquo; In the spring of <a href="./1911.html">1911</a> the Athletic Board voted to secure a regular coach. Edward J. O’Connor from Bates College was hired and coached until <a href="./1914.html">1914</a>. In the very successful indoor season of <a href="./1912.html">1912</a> the relay team was undefeated. In the spring season Brown won the triangular meet with Trinity and W.P.I., taking twelve of fourteen first places, and finished second in the New England Intercollegiates, and Norman Taber ’13 tied for first with John Paul Jones of Cornell in the IC4A’s mile. Another star of that team, Arthur Bartlett ’14, had already broken all three of Brown’s weight records – the hammer, discus, and shot, all in his freshman year. He went on to break the New England shot put record. In <a href="./1913.html">1913</a> Brown finished second again in the New Englands, and Taber set new New England records in the mile and half-mile. Archie Hahn, who won three medals in the <a href="./1904.html">1904</a> Olympics, coached from <a href="./1915.html">1915</a> to <a href="./1920.html">1920</a>, and Brown came in second in the New Englands in <a href="./1917.html">1917</a>, <a href="./1918.html">1918</a>, and <a href="./1920.html">1920</a>. In <a href="./1928.html">1928</a> John Collier ’29 set a new record in the 120-yard high hurdles in the New Englands, and finished second in that event in the IC4A’s. In his senior year he finished first in the 120-yard high hurdles and the 220-yard low hurdles in the New Englands, and first in the 120-yard high hurdles in the IC4A’s. In <a href="./1933.html">1933</a> Thomas Gilbane ’33 won an IC4A championship in the shot put.</p><p>The coaches after Archie Hahn were Alfred W. Haddleton, who had coached at Providence Technical High School and Moses Brown School and filled in at Brown in <a href="./1920.html">1920</a>-21, James E. Smith <a href="./1892.html">1892</a> from <a href="./1921.html">1921</a> to <a href="./1923.html">1923</a>, John Frederick Powers, former Notre Dame track star and coach at Worcester Academy, from <a href="./1924.html">1924</a> to <a href="./1938.html">1938</a>, and Malcolm Williams from <a href="./1938.html">1938</a> to <a href="./1941.html">1941</a>. <a href="./Anderson, George K..html">George Anderson</a> began coaching in <a href="./1941.html">1941</a>, but left for the Navy in <a href="./1942.html">1942</a>, and was replaced by Roland K. Brown, who coached from <a href="./1942.html">1942</a> until <a href="./1944.html">1944</a>, with football coach Neil “ldquo;Skip”rdquo; Stahley designated as acting coach during those years. Another football coach, Charles A. “ldquo;Rip”rdquo; Engle, was named coach in <a href="./1944.html">1944</a>. Carl S. Hector coached in <a href="./1945.html">1945</a>.</p><p>When Ivan Fuqua, a member of the record-breaking <a href="./1600.html">1600</a>-meter relay team in the <a href="./1932.html">1932</a> Olympics and former coach at the University of Connecticut, came to Brown in <a href="./1946.html">1946</a>, he was assured that a new field house and track would soon be built. Before this happened he had to leave, retiring in <a href="./1974.html">1974</a>. Fuqua’s teams won New England track and field titles in <a href="./1949.html">1949</a>, <a href="./1960.html">1960</a>, and <a href="./1961.html">1961</a>. Individual stars included <a href="./1947.html">1947</a> and <a href="./1948.html">1948</a> NAAU hammer throw champion and <a href="./1948.html">1948</a> Olympic team member Bob Bennett ’48, NAAU 40-yard champion Bill Dwyer ’48, national high jump champion Dick Phillips ’50 (who won the IC4A, NCAA, and NAAU championships in <a href="./1949.html">1949</a>), and Gil Borjeson ’52, who in consecutive weeks in his junior year won both the NAAU and the IC4A shot put titles, and was NCAA hammer throw champion in <a href="./1952.html">1952</a>.</p><p>In <a href="./1973.html">1973</a> the Heptagonals were held at Brown for the first time in twenty years. In <a href="./1975.html">1975</a> Brown came within one-tenth of a second of an undefeated season when the team lost to Dartmouth in the final event of the dual meet, the mile relay which Dartmouth won, 3:17.7 to Brown’s 3:17.8, for a final score of Dartmouth 78, Brown 76. In the <a href="./1988.html">1988</a> NCAA track and field championships Greg Whiteley ’89 placed third in the 5,000 meters and Chris Schille ’88 finished seventh in the 10,000 meters.</p><p>Doug Terry followed Fuqua in <a href="./1974.html">1974</a>. He resigned in the fall of <a href="./1984.html">1984</a>. Bob Rothenberg ’65 was named coordinator of track and men’s cross country in May <a href="./1983.html">1983</a> and director of track and cross country for men and women in <a href="./1987.html">1987</a>.</p><h2>Cross Country</h2><p>Cross country running made an informal appearance around the turn of the century, although it was pointed out in the fall of <a href="./1903.html">1903</a> that these “ldquo;runs”rdquo; were held for exercise, and not to develop material for the track team. In January <a href="./1906.html">1906</a> the <i>Brown Alumni Monthly</i> announced, “ldquo;Cross country running has become firmly fixed as a fall sport at Brown. In the final contest the prize cups for first and second places were won by J. H. Wells ’09, with 4 1/2 minutes handicap, and A. L. Wright ’06, scratch.... The best actual time was made by A. L. Wright ’06, 22m. 48s., over a course of four and one-half miles.”rdquo; Brown was able to get together a cross-country team in <a href="./1910.html">1910</a> under the training of Charlie Huggins. Manager John E. Hinckley ’11 reported in the <a href="./1911.html">1911</a> <i><a href="./Liber Brunensis.html">Liber Brunensis</a>:</i></p><blockquote>“ldquo;For the first time in the history of athletics at Brown, last fall the University was represented by a cross-country team. In years past, Brown has occasionally had individual point winners in various cross-country meets, but never before has she been able to send out an organized team. Soon after the opening of college, a squad of some ten or a dozen men began a little cross-country work, although no actual training was done until the 1st of October, when it was announced that a triangular race between M.I.T., Tufts and Brown had been scheduled. In the week that remained to get into condition, the men did their hardest work of the season, and on November 4 a squad of eight men, under the leadership of Captain Roper, left for Brookline. The race was over the regular M.I.T. four and a quarter mile course, starting in Roxbury and ending by a quarter-mile sprint on the track at Technology Field. The Brown team scored an unlooked-for victory, winning the meet by a safe margin; the final score being: Brown 29, M.I.T. 34, Tufts 85. N. S. Taber ’13 won first place, passing Davis of Tech in the last two hundred yards by a remarkably strong sprint. The race was won in 25 minutes, 26 1/2 seconds, which was very good time considering that the runners were obliged to face a driving rain storm.”rdquo;</blockquote>In the second season of cross-country running in <a href="./1911.html">1911</a>, what heralded by the <i>Brown Daily Herald</i> as the “ldquo;first meet of its kind ever held in Providence”rdquo; took place between Brown and M.I.T. on November 15 on a newly laid out course of four and one-half miles from <a href="./Andrews Field.html">Andrews Field</a> through the East Side to the Seekonk River, around York Pond, and back to the Field. M.I.T. defeated Brown by a close score of 40-45. In November <a href="./1912.html">1912</a> Brown defeated the Massachusetts Agricultural College, taking the first five places, came in second after Dartmouth in the New England Collegiate run, and was fourth in a six-mile run at Cornell entered by ten colleges. In the only dual meets held in the next two years Brown defeated the Massachusetts Agricultural College 19-41 in <a href="./1913.html">1913</a> and Worcester Polytechnic Institute 26-31 in <a href="./1914.html">1914</a>. Interest in cross country seems to have lapsed, but in <a href="./1922.html">1922</a> the team, after an unsuccessful season of dual meets, came in sixth in the New England Intercollegiates. In <a href="./1924.html">1924</a> John Frederick Powers, former Notre Dame track star and coach at Worcester Academy, began to coach the team, which endured several more losing seasons. Cross country was revived in <a href="./1946.html">1946</a> under coach Ivan Fuqua, and the Brown team, led by Jon and Josh Tobey ’50, won all but one of the dual meets. The next year Brown again won all but one dual meet and came in fourth in the Heptagonals and fourteenth in the IC4A meet. <a href="./1956.html">1956</a> was the best season (3-3) since <a href="./1949.html">1949</a>. Brown’s defeat of Dartmouth was the first victory over an Ivy opponent in cross country history at Brown. Ed Sullivan ’58 finished sixth in the annual Heptagonal Cross Country Championships in New York and second in the New England Cross Country Championships. The next year’s record was 4-2 in dual meets, and Sullivan won the Heptagonals with a sprained ankle. Brown’s first undefeated cross country team in <a href="./1960.html">1960</a> defeated ten opponents for a 5-0 record, beating Yale for the first time, won the New Englands, came in third in the Heptagonals, and tenth in the IC4A’s. Captain Bob Lowe ’61 finished first in all five meets, set new records for Boston’s Franklin Park’s 4.2 mile course (19:30) and Providence College’s 4.5 mile course (21:29.3), finished first in the New Englands (for the second year), the Heptagonals, and the IC4A’s.<p>Ivan Fuqua’s teams won New England championships in <a href="./1960.html">1960</a>, <a href="./1962.html">1962</a>, and <a href="./1963.html">1963</a>. The <a href="./1962.html">1962</a> team was sixth in the IC4A’s. In <a href="./1963.html">1963</a> David Farley ’64 won both the IC4A indoor and outdoor mile, and led the team to a 7-1 record and a second New England title. In the late 1960s cross country began to go down hill until it hit its lowest level in <a href="./1982.html">1982</a>, when the minimum of five team members to send to a meet could not be assembled. When Bob Rothenberg ’65 took over in <a href="./1983.html">1983</a>, he had an inexperienced team and no place to go but up. In <a href="./1986.html">1986</a> the cross county team had its best season in twenty years, thanks to star runners Chris Schille ’88 and Greg Whiteley ’89, and dependable David Alden ’87. The season saw Brown’s best records: second place in <a href="./Ivy League.html">Ivy League</a> with 5-2 in dual meets, sixth in the New Englands, fourth in the Heptagonals, and sixteenth in the IC4A’s. In <a href="./1987.html">1987</a> Brown, running as a team in the NCAA’s for the first time since <a href="./1963.html">1963</a>, finished ninth, the best place ever attained by a Brown team. Rothenberg’s nine-year record from <a href="./1983.html">1983</a> to <a href="./1991.html">1991</a> was 42-18.</p><h2>Women’s Track and Cross Country</h2><p>In <a href="./1974.html">1974</a> two women students, Karen Zaccor ’78 and Andrea Thach ’77, wanted to start track and cross country for women. They received the support of physical education director Arlene Gorton, and the teams were formed in <a href="./1975.html">1975</a>. Jonathan Hird ’74 MAT was the part-time coach for both teams until <a href="./1979.html">1979</a>. In the spring of <a href="./1978.html">1978</a> the women’s track team, with a 4-1 dual meet record, became the first Brown women’s team to win an <a href="./Ivy League.html">Ivy League</a> championship. The next year the team came in second in the <a href="./Ivy League.html">Ivy League</a> in a meet held at Brown, and, with only eight runners, won the New New England championships. Brown won the New Englands for a second time in <a href="./1980.html">1980</a>. In <a href="./1979.html">1979</a> Sirkka Liisa Williams became the first full time coach for the women’s teams. Sue Latter Addison coached for one year in <a href="./1981.html">1981</a>-82. Jon Hird returned in <a href="./1982.html">1982</a> and coached until <a href="./1986.html">1986</a>. Teri Smith ’91 set indoor and outdoor records in the 200 meter dash in <a href="./1989.html">1989</a>, and in <a href="./1991.html">1991</a> won the 200 and 400 meter dashes and anchored the relay team which set a new <a href="./1600.html">1600</a> meter relay record. In <a href="./1990.html">1990</a>-91 the women’s team came in second of ten in both the indoor and outdoor Heptagonals. The <a href="./1992.html">1992</a> team won the Heptagonal Women’s Indoor Championships. Coach Bob Rothenberg’s five-year record since <a href="./1986.html">1986</a> was 25-5 (16-2 indoor and 9-3 outdoor).</p><p>In <a href="./1979.html">1979</a> the women’s cross country team had a 7-2 dual meet record, won the Rhode Island championships, and came in fourth in the New England championships. Anne Sullivan ’82, Harvard’s first woman All-American, transferred to Brown in <a href="./1979.html">1979</a>, and set <a href="./Ivy League.html">Ivy League</a> records in the 3,000 and 5,000 meters at the outdoor championships in <a href="./1979.html">1979</a>, placed sixth in the 10,000 meters in the national outdoor track championships in <a href="./1979.html">1979</a>, eighteenth in the national cross country championships in <a href="./1980.html">1980</a>, fourth in the Olympic trials (10,000 meters) in <a href="./1980.html">1980</a>, and set a record in the indoor track American Collegiate three-mile in <a href="./1980.html">1980</a>.
