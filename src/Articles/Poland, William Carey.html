Davison ’09 had recollections at Poland’s art class in upper <a href="./Manning Hall.html">Manning Hall</a>, where doors flapped in the draft from the big outside door below and also from the exodus of a number of Poland’s students as he darkened the room for the purpose of showing lantern slides of great art. Finally the students felt sorry for this behavior and to show Poland their affection, presented him with a silver loving cup. Davison recalled that Poland was deeply touched, yet managed to make “ldquo;the speech of a Christian gentleman to a band of raw youngsters of plastic age whose lives cannot fail to have been moulded by it.”rdquo; He continued as professor of the history of art until his retirement in <a href="./1915.html">1915</a>.
