In <a href="articles/1891.html">1891</a>-92 he was annual director of the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, and on his return was named the first professor of the history of art at Brown. He also served as the curator of the Museum of Classical Archaeology from <a href="articles/1889.html">1889</a> to <a href="articles/1893.html">1893</a>. In the year <a href="articles/1875.html">1875</a>-76 he studied at the Universities of Berlin and Leipzig. He was hired by Mrs. John Carter Brown to teach Latin to her sons, John Nicholas and Harold, and in <a href="articles/1878.html">1878</a> was given a leave of absence from his duties at Brown to travel to Europe with the Browns to tutor his young charges. His leave was extended to <a href="articles/1881.html">1881</a> so he might prepare them for college. They entered Brown in <a href="articles/1881.html">1881</a> and <a href="articles/1882.html">1882</a>.</p><p>He was well liked by his students, who also took advantage of him. Herbert F. Davison ’09 had recollections at Poland’s art class in upper <a href="articles/Manning Hall.html">Manning Hall</a>, where doors flapped in the draft from the big outside door below and also from the exodus of a number of Poland’s students as he darkened the room for the purpose of showing lantern slides of great art. Finally the students felt sorry for this behavior and to show Poland their affection, presented him with a silver loving cup. Davison recalled that Poland was deeply touched, yet managed to make “the speech of a Christian gentleman to a band of raw youngsters of plastic age whose lives cannot fail to have been moulded by it.” He continued as professor of the history of art until his retirement in <a href="articles/1915.html">1915</a>. He was president of the <a href="articles/Rhode Island School of Design.html">Rhode Island School of Design</a> from <a href="articles/1896.html">1896</a> to <a href="articles/1907.html">1907</a>.

He died in Providence on March 19, <a href="articles/1929.html">1929</a>.
