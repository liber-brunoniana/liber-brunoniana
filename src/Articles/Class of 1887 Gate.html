<p>The Class of <a href="./1887.html">1887</a> Gate was designed by Hoppin and Ely and built by Norcross Brothers on Waterman Street in <a href="./1903.html">1903</a>. The verse beside the gate was written by <a href="./Green, Theodore Francis.html">Theodore Francis Green</a> <a href="./1887.html">1887</a>.</p><blockquote>Welcome, O undergraduate,<br />Within this ’87 gate!<br />All entering here find hope endures,<br />The fount of knowledge still allures,<br />And here good fellowship abides<br />To cheer and help whate’er betides.</blockquote>Line 3 of the verse is a paraphrase of <a href="./Dante.html">Dante</a>’s <i>Hell,</i> Canto III, Line 9, “All hope abandon, ye who enter here.” It also applies to “Hope” College at the right inside the gate. The “fount” in line 4 is the college pump in back of <a href="./Hope College.html">Hope College</a>, and the home of “good fellowship” is the <a href="./Brown Union.html">Brown Union</a> at the left inside the gate.
