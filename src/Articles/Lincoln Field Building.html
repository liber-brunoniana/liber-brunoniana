<p>The <a href="./Lincoln Field.html">Lincoln Field</a> Building was erected in <a href="./1903.html">1903</a> as the <a href="./Engineering.html">Engineering</a> Building. It was designed by Clark and Howe of Providence and built by Maguire and Penniman of Providence. Three stories high, it was built with a view to solidity and maximum light. The second floor was supported by large beams to hold heavy machinery. The top floor’s “ldquo;saw tooth”rdquo; skylights, facing north, were particularly adapted to a room used for drafting. The student handbook described the new building as “ldquo;mill-type”rdquo; construction and called it “ldquo;Machinery Hall.”rdquo; When Professor <a href="./Kenerson, William H..html">William H. Kenerson</a> first sought new quarters for engineering, he had to convince <a href="./Chace, Arnold Buffum.html">Arnold Buffum Chace</a>, Chancellor of the University, who was not in favor of engineering education and felt that $25,000 was too much to spend. After a trip with Kenerson to view Stevens Institute of Technology, Chace persuaded the University to erect the engineering building at a cost of about $85,000. Chace still opposed the use of new-fangled electric lighting in the building and insisted on kerosene lamps. The engineers were able to acquired a small steam driven generator, wired the building themselves, and for a number of years produced their own current. When more space was needed, a temporary structure was added on the east side of the building. Built of sheet iron and unfinished inside, the addition was unheated until the engineers, with their usual ingenuity, placed a big blower in a duct between the two sections and forced warm air into the addition. <a href="./Engineering.html">Engineering</a> acquired new quarters in the Barus-Holley Building, built in <a href="./1964.html">1964</a>. The <a href="./Lincoln Field.html">Lincoln Field</a> Building is now occupied by the Department of Geological Sciences.</p>
