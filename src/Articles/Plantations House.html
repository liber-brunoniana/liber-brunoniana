<p>Plantations House was opened in the fall of <a href="./1954.html">1954</a> as a dormitory center for commuting students. The University renovated the former Lambda Chi Alpha house at 32 George Street, furnishing a lounge and study rooms on the first floor and dormitory accommodations on the upper floor. The concept of Plantations House was to give commuters a place to meet and study during the day and a place to stay overnight after evening functions. The students built party rooms in the basement, fielded intramural teams, and invited faculty guests to Wednesday night discussions. In the fall of <a href="./1962.html">1962</a> Plantations House was assigned to the house at 20 Benevolent Street, and was later located at 219 Bowen Street from about <a href="./1970.html">1970</a> until the early 1980s, when there was no further need for a day center for commuters.</p>
