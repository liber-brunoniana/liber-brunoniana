<p>The President of Brown University is in charge of the immediate government of the University and reports to the <a href="./Corporation.html">Corporation</a>.

He was president for 26 years, and after his unexpected death on July 29, <a href="./1791.html">1791</a>, the <a href="./Corporation.html">Corporation</a> requested that <a href="./Howell, David.html">David Howell</a> write to the Reverend <a href="./Jones, Samuel.html">Samuel Jones</a> to offer him the presidency. In his reply, dated August 15, <a href="./1791.html">1791</a>, Jones says, “ldquo;The appointment would be so far above my abilities and other qualifications; it would be so unsuitable for a man so far advanced in years (fifty-six) to enter upon a new scene in life ... I would lay before the <a href="./Corporation.html">Corporation</a> the names of the Hon. <a href="./Howell, David.html">David Howell</a>, and the Rev. <a href="./Maxcy, Jonathan.html">Jonathan Maxcy</a>, both of Providence. Should it be decided that the clause in the charter respecting a President militates against the one, and want of years against the other, (for a man may be too young as well as too old,) I would then suggest the expediency of casting an eye over the Atlantic.”rdquo; <a href="./Maxcy, Jonathan.html">Jonathan Maxcy</a> <a href="./1787.html">1787</a> did become president in <a href="./1792.html">1792</a>, although he was called president <i>pro tem</i> for the first five years, as he was only 24 at the time of his election. He left in <a href="./1802.html">1802</a> to become president of Union College and was succeeded by another graduate of the College, <a href="./Messer, Asa.html">Asa Messer</a> <a href="./1790.html">1790</a>. Messer had been a tutor and then a professor, but he also was president <i>pro tem</i> until <a href="./1804.html">1804</a>. He resigned in <a href="./1826.html">1826</a> because his theological differences with the <a href="./Corporation.html">Corporation</a> had led to dissension in the College. <a href="./Wayland, Francis.html">Francis Wayland</a>, educated at Union College and the first non-graduate of Brown since Manning, began his presidency of 28 years in <a href="./1827.html">1827</a>. He offered his resignation in <a href="./1849.html">1849</a> when his proposed curricular reforms had not been supported, but withdrew his resignation when his “ldquo;new system”rdquo; was accepted. He retired in <a href="./1855.html">1855</a>.</p><p>The next six presidents were all graduates of Brown. <a href="./Sears, Barnas.html">Barnas Sears</a> <a href="./1825.html">1825</a> was the first to have been president of another educational institution (Newton Theological Institution) before becoming president of Brown. When Sears resigned, the presidency was offered to Martin B. Anderson and to <a href="./Robinson, Ezekiel Gilman.html">Ezekiel Gilman Robinson</a>, both of whom declined. Professor <a href="./Caswell, Alexis.html">Alexis Caswell</a> <a href="./1822.html">1822</a> was called out of retirement to become president in <a href="./1868.html">1868</a>. <a href="./Robinson, Ezekiel Gilman.html">Ezekiel Gilman Robinson</a> <a href="./1838.html">1838</a>, who had earlier declined, was persuaded to accept the presidency in <a href="./1872.html">1872</a>.

He resigned in <a href="./1897.html">1897</a> in a controversy over the right of the <a href="./Corporation.html">Corporation</a> to limit the free expression of his personal views on the free coinage of silver. Asked to withdraw his resignation, he did so, but left a year later. William Herbert Perry Faunce <a href="./1880.html">1880</a>, who served the longest presidential term from <a href="./1899.html">1899</a> to <a href="./1929.html">1929</a>, differed from all the former presidents since Manning in that he had not engaged in college teaching except for freshman mathematics during the absence of Professor Benjamin F. Clarke <a href="./1863.html">1863</a> in <a href="./1881.html">1881</a>-82.

He was succeeded in <a href="./1937.html">1937</a> by Henry Merritt Wriston, who was a Methodist, a graduate of Wesleyan University, and former president of Lawrence College. His eighteen years as president were marked by the building of the residential quadrangle which bears his name, and the subsequent growth of the student body in size and geographical distribution. <a href="./Keeney, Barnaby C..html">Barnaby C.

In <a href="./1989.html">1989</a> <a href="./Gregorian, Vartan.html">Vartan Gregorian</a>, the first foreign-born president of Brown, a native of Lebanon and a graduate of Stanford University, was inaugurated.</p><p>On occasion the role of the president was filled by another. <a href="./Howell, David.html">David Howell</a> was acting president in <a href="./1791.html">1791</a>-92, after the death of <a href="./Manning, James.html">James Manning</a>. <a href="./Woods, Alva.html">Alva Woods</a> was acting president in <a href="./1826.html">1826</a>-27, after the resignation of <a href="./Messer, Asa.html">Asa Messer</a>. <a href="./Caswell, Alexis.html">Alexis Caswell</a> served as president <i>pro tempore</i> in <a href="./1840.html">1840</a>-41 during <a href="./Wayland, Francis.html">Francis Wayland</a>’s trip to Europe. <a href="./Chace, George Ide.html">George Ide Chace</a> was acting president in <a href="./1867.html">1867</a>-68, after the resignation of <a href="./Sears, Barnas.html">Barnas Sears</a>.

In fact there seems to have been no public installation of the first five presidents. President Sears was presented at <a href="./Commencement.html">Commencement</a> on September 5, <a href="./1855.html">1855</a>, when Chancellor Samuel B. Tobey presented resolutions of the retirement of President Wayland and announced the election of Sears.</p><p>President Caswell’s inauguration was described in the <i>Providence Journal</i> of February 18, <a href="./1868.html">1868</a>:</p><blockquote>“ldquo;The Reverend <a href="./Caswell, Alexis.html">Alexis Caswell</a>, D.D., LL.D., was yesterday morning, in accordance with established usage, inducted into the office ... The ceremony, which was of an extremely impressive though simple character, took place in <a href="./Manning Hall.html">Manning Hall</a> immediately before the usual morning service. Besides the <a href="./Faculty.html">Faculty</a> and students, several prominent members of the <a href="./Corporation.html">Corporation</a> were present.”rdquo;</blockquote>The Chancellor made an appropriate address. Caswell “ldquo;made a felicitous response,”rdquo; and “ldquo;At the close of the addresses the usual devotional services were proceeded with, closing with singing and a recitation of the Lord’s Prayer by the students.”rdquo;<p>President Robinson was inaugurated on September 9, <a href="./1872.html">1872</a> at the beginning of the college year. He was, as President Caswell had been, presented at chapel exercises, which were reported thus in the <i>Providence Journal:</i></p><blockquote>“ldquo;Arrangement having been made by a committee appointed for the purpose at the recent meeting of the <a href="./Corporation.html">Corporation</a> of Brown University, to have some proper service in connection with the assumption of his official duties by Dr. Robinson as President of the University, <a href="./Manning Hall.html">Manning Hall</a> was filled Monday morning with members of the <a href="./Corporation.html">Corporation</a>, the <a href="./Faculty.html">Faculty</a> and students of the College, who met to participate in this service. On the entrance of President Robinson with Chancellor Patten, he was received with such applause as only students know how to give, the whole audience rising to their feet.”rdquo;</blockquote>William Patten’s charge to the new president had a particularly nautical eloquence:<blockquote>“ldquo;To-day you take a new departure. You embark on a staunch ship. The vessel is not new to you, nor the seas unknown. In former years, you were a hand on one of her periodical voyages. You are now her chosen Commander and Pilot. You have a gallant ship’s company – the <a href="./Faculty.html">Faculty</a> are all your officers, the Students your crew, and we and they all are sharers in the results of her voyages. May each return find her freighted with treasures of every age and clime; always so fortunate and prospered that, to have sailed in her shall assure riches and a distinction throughout the land.”rdquo;</blockquote><p>The inauguration of President Andrews took place at the first chapel service of the academic year at 8:30 A.M. on Wednesday, September 18, <a href="./1889.html">1889</a>. The <i>Providence Journal</i> reported, “ldquo;It had been announced this morning that in addition to the regular service there would be a formal introduction of President Andrews by Hon. Thomas Durfee, LL.D., of the Board of Fellows. The announcement was significant enough to draw nearly every student into the hall, and the Professors who were in the city, and a large number of Alumni also made their appearance.”rdquo; Ex-Chancellor Durfee performed the induction in place of Samuel L. Caldwell, Secretary of the <a href="./Corporation.html">Corporation</a>, who was prevented by illness, and Chancellor <a href="./Goddard, William Giles.html">William Goddard</a>, who was unable to replace him, being on the way home from Europe. Durfee’s speech of introduction was interrupted each time he mentioned Andrews, as the students applauded their former teacher who was returning as president.</p><p>On the occasion of President Faunce’s inauguration five divisions made up the procession to the <a href="./First Baptist Church.html">First Baptist Church</a> on the afternoon of October 17, <a href="./1899.html">1899</a>. Chancellor Goddard, President Eliot of Harvard, President Patton of Princeton, President Harper of Chicago, and Faunce all spoke. Reeves’s orchestra, augmented to thirty pieces, played, and the Glee Club sang. In the evening there was a reception in <a href="./Sayles Hall.html">Sayles Hall</a>.</p><p>President Barbour was inducted by Chancellor <a href="./Chace, Arnold Buffum.html">Arnold Buffum Chace</a> on Friday, October 18, <a href="./1929.html">1929</a>, in the <a href="./First Baptist Church.html">First Baptist Church</a>. Presidents A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard and Livingston Farrand of Cornell were the speakers for the 130 delegates from colleges and universities, 64 of whom were the presidents of their institutions. At the time of Wriston’s inauguration in <a href="./1937.html">1937</a>, J. Earl Clauson, describing the inauguration of Barbour in <a href="./1929.html">1929</a>, wrote in the <i>Providence Journal,</i> “ldquo;The inauguration ... came closer to bursting Brown’s cocoon of New England reticence than anything which had preceded it. That event was spread over three days, with recitations more or less suspended, colors flying and a general air of release from inhibitions.”rdquo; There were receptions in <a href="./Sayles Hall.html">Sayles Hall</a> on October 16 and 17, a reception at Pembroke on the morning of the inauguration, and a dinner at the Biltmore following the ceremony.</p><p>At President’s Wriston’s request, his installation was relatively simple. There were 900 invited guests, who marched to <a href="./Sayles Hall.html">Sayles Hall</a> for the ceremony at 4:00 o’clock on Wednesday, February 3, <a href="./1937.html">1937</a>. Students in their dormitories were able to hear the ceremonies broadcast by the Brown Network, and the general public listened in <a href="./Faunce House.html">Faunce House</a>.</p><p>President Keeney’s inauguration on Monday, October 31, <a href="./1955.html">1955</a>, was attended by 25 college presidents and 83 delegates from colleges and universities, among them Robert M. Keeney, who attended his son’s inauguration as alumnus and delegate of the Colorado School of Mines. John Nicholas Brown, the senior member present of the Board of Fellows, administered the oath of engagement at noon in <a href="./Sayles Hall.html">Sayles Hall</a>. The principal speaker was John W. Gardner, president of the Carnegie <a href="./Corporation.html">Corporation</a> of New York, who spoke on “ldquo;American Higher <a href="./Education.html">Education</a>.”rdquo; As a salute to Keeney’s interest in medieval history, the combined choirs of Brown and Pembroke sang the medieval anthem, “ldquo;Veni Creator Spiritus.”rdquo;</p><p>President Heffner’s inauguration was held on Saturday morning, October 15, <a href="./1966.html">1966</a>, in Meehan auditorium. On the evening before the Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra presented a special concert in honor of the new president in Veterans Memorial Auditorium. At the inaugural exercises an address was delivered by Dr. Herman B. Wells, Chancellor of Indiana University, who was president of that institution when Heffner joined its faculty.</p><p>President Hornig was inaugurated on Sunday, October 4, <a href="./1970.html">1970</a>. Earlier in the day he had attended morning worship in <a href="./Sayles Hall.html">Sayles Hall</a>, where President George A. Owens of <a href="./Tougaloo College.html">Tougaloo College</a> spoke. The other members of his party left the service in a limousine, while Hornig chose to walk across the campus to the luncheon prepared for delegates and guests. The inaugural procession formed on the Pembroke <a href="./Campus.html">Campus</a> and marched to <a href="./Meehan Auditorium.html">Meehan Auditorium</a>, where 3,500 persons, including the delegates of 81 colleges and universities, attended the ceremony of inauguration.</p><p>President Swearer was reluctant to have an elaborate inauguration, but was persuaded that this was a necessary rite. For eleven days the University celebrated, managing to schedule other events such as Parents Weekend and a conference on the novel to augment the inaugural festivities. The three-day conference on the novel, intended to mark the tenth anniversary of the literary journal, <i><a href="./Novel.html">Novel</a>,</i> featured novelists John Gardner and Gail Godwin. On the day before the inauguration there was a panel discussion on “ldquo;The Role of Values in Communal Living,”rdquo; an essay by <a href="./Dean.html">Dean</a> Thomas Bechtel, and an evening concert by the Brown Chorus. On the day of inauguration, Saturday, April 16, <a href="./1977.html">1977</a>, Harvard president Derek Bok spoke in <a href="./Sayles Hall.html">Sayles Hall</a> in the morning on “ldquo;Liberal <a href="./Education.html">Education</a> and Values for the Twenty-first Century.”rdquo; There followed a panel discussion of his address in which University of Rhode Island President Frank Newman ’47, <a href="./Tougaloo College.html">Tougaloo College</a> President George Owens, and Acting President Harriet Sheridan of Carleton College participated.
