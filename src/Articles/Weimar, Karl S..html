In a speech which Frederick Love had prepared to deliver at a dinner on February 12 to honor retirees, he wrote:</p><blockquote>“It can truly be said the German Studies at Brown would look quite different today had it not been for Karl Weimar. His arrival and survival here signalled the beginning of a transition which ultimately saw the study of German redirected toward the 20th century and contemporary developments ... Together with the late Alan Holske he guided the first theses and dissertations that were completed in the post-war phase of graduate school expansion. For a time Karl was so heavily involved in promoting (or fathering) student research and writing that he was affectionately known to a whole generation of graduate students as ‘Vati’ (the equivalent of ‘Dad’).”</blockquote>
