She constantly encouraged capable young women to seek a rich intellectual life. She exhorted them from her desk in <a href="./Pembroke Hall.html">Pembroke Hall</a>, from the lectern in <a href="./Alumnae Hall.html">Alumnae Hall</a>, and from the halls of colleges and universities throughout the United States, and, perhaps most graciously of all, by the example of her own life.<p>“She saw no conflict between the traditional role of women as wives and mothers, and the role of women in search of advanced scholarly degrees. She could not countenance the waste of intellectual talent; she eagerly urged brilliant women to seek professorships and just as eagerly she encouraged colleges to employ women professors. Her most meaningful demonstration of this principle was her own final bequest to give support to a Woman Professor on the Brown <a href="./Faculty.html">Faculty</a>.”</p></blockquote>
