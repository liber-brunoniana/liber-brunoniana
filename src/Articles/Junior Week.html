There was a “Country Fair” with side-show tents on <a href="./Lincoln Field.html">Lincoln Field</a>, and in one corner of the field there were horse races, in which four old nags raced, sometimes being pulled along by the clowns, until one of the horses stumbled over a rope into the crowd, injuring three women spectators.

For many years it was customary for the <i>Brown Daily Herald</i> to print an issue which listed the men who were attending the junior prom with the names and cities of residence of their dates. In <a href="./1928.html">1928</a> the prom was moved from <a href="./Sayles Hall.html">Sayles Hall</a> to the new Gymnasium.
