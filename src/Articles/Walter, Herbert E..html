The memorial minute of the faculty said of him:</p><blockquote>“ldquo;Many of Dr. Walter’s personal characteristics were deep rooted in the cultural traditions and homely virtues that prevailed in the section of rural Vermont where he and generations of his forebears were born and reared. He was fundamentally a good neighbor in the Scriptural sense of that word, sensitive to the fortunes and misfortunes of friends and strangers, sympathetic and ready to help, but never intrusive. ... He was ‘soft-spoken’ but direct and unequivocal, singularly averse to dispute or argument even over points of scientific fact of interpretation. His droll and soul-saving humor never deserted him.”rdquo;</blockquote>
