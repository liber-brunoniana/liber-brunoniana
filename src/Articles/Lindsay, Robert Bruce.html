<p>R(obert) Bruce Lindsay (<a href="./1900.html">1900</a>-<a href="./1985.html">1985</a>), professor of physics, was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, on January 1, <a href="./1900.html">1900</a>. He graduated from Brown in <a href="./1920.html">1920</a>, receiving both a bachelor of arts and a master of science degree that year. He was a graduate student and instructor in physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the next two years. In the <a href="./1922.html">1922</a>-23 academic year he studied, as a Fellow of the American-Scandinavian Foundation, at the Institute of Theoretical <a href="./Physics.html">Physics</a> in Copenhagen under Niels Bohr (who won the Nobel prize that year) and H. A. Kramer. Kramer asked Lindsay and his wife to translate his book with H. Holst, <i>Bohrs Atomteori, Almenfatteligt Fremstillet,</i> into <a href="./English.html">English</a>. According to Lindsay, Mrs. Lindsay (Rachel T. Easterbrooks ’20) did much of the translation and he helped with the technical aspects. Their translation was published by Gyldendal in <a href="./1923.html">1923</a> with the title, <i>The Atom and the Bohr Theory of its Structure,</i> and was published in the United States by Knopf in <a href="./1924.html">1924</a>. The Lindsays used the approximately $125 they had received for the translation in traveling around Europe in the summer of <a href="./1923.html">1923</a>. On his return, Lindsay completed his dissertation on the atomic models of the alkali metals, which he had begun in Copenhagen, and received his Ph.D. from M.I.T. in <a href="./1924.html">1924</a>. He went to Yale as instructor in physics in <a href="./1923.html">1923</a> and was promoted to assistant professor in <a href="./1927.html">1927</a>. He came back to Brown in <a href="./1930.html">1930</a> as associate professor of theoretical physics. He was named Hazard Professor of <a href="./Physics.html">Physics</a> in <a href="./1936.html">1936</a> and chairman of the <a href="./Physics.html">Physics</a> Department in <a href="./1934.html">1934</a>, a post which he held until he became dean of the <a href="./Graduate School.html">Graduate School</a> in <a href="./1954.html">1954</a>. He taught one of the first University Courses on “ldquo;The Role of Science in Civilization”rdquo; and another course on “ldquo;Energy and Man.”rdquo; He published a number of textbooks, among them, <i>Acoustics – A Text on Theory and Applications</i> with G. W. Stewart in <a href="./1934.html">1934</a>, <i>Physical Mechanics</i> in <a href="./1933.html">1933</a>, <i>Foundations of <a href="./Physics.html">Physics</a></i> with Henry Margenau in <a href="./1936.html">1936</a>, <i>Concepts and Methods of Theoretical <a href="./Physics.html">Physics</a></i> in <a href="./1951.html">1951</a> (with a Japanese translation published in <a href="./1957.html">1957</a>). He also published <i>The Nature of <a href="./Physics.html">Physics</a></i> in <a href="./1968.html">1968</a>, <i>Lord Rayleigh, The Man and His Work</i> in <a href="./1970.html">1970</a>, and <i>Julius Robert Mayer, Prophet of Energy</i> in <a href="./1973.html">1973</a>. He retired as dean of the <a href="./Graduate School.html">Graduate School</a> in <a href="./1966.html">1966</a> and from teaching in <a href="./1970.html">1970</a>. He died on March 2, <a href="./1985.html">1985</a> in Newport, Rhode Island.</p>
