<p>Botany was taught at Brown in <a href="./1811.html">1811</a> by <a href="./Drowne, Solomon.html">Solomon Drowne</a> <a href="./1773.html">1773</a>, professor of materia medica and botany, in the newly established medical lectures. The course was designed for medical students, but undergraduates could attend the lectures by paying a fee. Edwards A. Park <a href="./1826.html">1826</a> was one of those students, and recalled his experience:“I had a very pleasant acquaintance with Dr. <a href="./Drowne, Solomon.html">Solomon Drowne</a>, and attended one course of his lectures on Botany. The course consisted of only twelve or fourteen lectures. They were illustrated by some botanical specimens, which, however, appeared to me quite ‘dry.’ His lectures were technical, and did not interest me. Still I was only sixteen years old when I heard them, and was not prepared for as many technicalities as he introduced.” Drowne’s lectures ended when the medical lectures were discontinued in <a href="./1827.html">1827</a>.</p><p>In February <a href="./1877.html">1877</a> the <i><a href="./Brunonian.html">Brunonian</a></i> announced, “Mr. W. W. Bailey of the class of ’64, has very kindly volunteered to give some lectures preparatory to the course in Field Botany ... The attendance, which is voluntary, is limited to the upperclassmen.” By soliciting subscriptions Bailey was able to procure ten botanical dissecting microscopes for the University. He also placed in the Museum an herbarium of <a href="./2000.html">2000</a> mounted and labelled specimens. Observing the success of Bailey’s lectures and the demand for more instruction in botany than had been previously available in the physiology course, <a href="./President.html">President</a> Robinson recommended that Bailey be retained to continue his voluntary course while the establishment of a professorship of geology with botany included was under consideration. In <a href="./1881.html">1881</a> Bailey was appointed to the newly established professorship of natural history, including botany, which was made possible through $25,000 from the estate of Stephen Thayer Olney, whose bequest also included his herbarium, his microscopes, 712 botanical books, and a $10,000 fund of which the income would be used for the purchase of plants and books. In November <a href="./1880.html">1880</a> James Lawrence Bennett, a local botanist, donated his herbarium of about 13,000 specimens. A condition of the bequest of the Olney herbarium was that it be placed in a fire-proof building, and a room in the basement of the new library was deemed acceptable, but was later found to be too damp and the herbaria were moved to the southeast room on the first floor of <a href="./Manning Hall.html">Manning Hall</a>. The herbaria were increased in <a href="./1883.html">1883</a> by the purchase of the collection of James F. Robinson of Manchester, England, and the gift of the herbarium of W. W. Ayres of Wickford, Rhode Island.</p><p>An advanced course in botany for juniors was introduced in <a href="./1889.html">1889</a>-90. In his report that year Bailey noted that “Botany has long since ceased to be a fancy or ornamental study,” and asked for the introduction of water into the laboratory, laboratory desks, and gas apparatus. In <a href="./1890.html">1890</a> James L. Bennett was placed in charge of the herbaria. The next year he was also named “Curator of the Museum of Economic Botany.” The herbarium moved once again in December <a href="./1895.html">1895</a>, this time to the basement of <a href="./Maxcy Hall.html">Maxcy Hall</a> where modern cases with 660 shelves had been provided. Winthrop J. V. Osterhout <a href="./1893.html">1893</a> was instructor in the department from <a href="./1893.html">1893</a> to <a href="./1895.html">1895</a>, and Haven Metcalf <a href="./1896.html">1896</a> from <a href="./1896.html">1896</a> to <a href="./1899.html">1899</a>. After Bennett’s departure, <a href="./Collins, James Franklin.html">James Franklin Collins</a> was curator of the herbarium from <a href="./1894.html">1894</a> to <a href="./1911.html">1911</a>, and curator of the museum of economic botany in <a href="./1894.html">1894</a>-95. He was instructor in botany from <a href="./1899.html">1899</a> to <a href="./1905.html">1905</a>, and assistant professor until <a href="./1911.html">1911</a>. Bailey retired in <a href="./1905.html">1905</a>, and Collins was replaced as assistant professor in <a href="./1911.html">1911</a> by Harlan H. York, who had recently earned a Ph.D. degree at Johns Hopkins University, and had been an instructor in botany at the University of Texas from <a href="./1906.html">1906</a> to <a href="./1909.html">1909</a>. A greenhouse, 18 by 25 feet, was erected in <a href="./1912.html">1912</a> in the rear of the house at 100 George Street. The Bureau of Plant Industry of the United States Department of Agriculture installed a laboratory of forest pathology in <a href="./Maxcy Hall.html">Maxcy Hall</a> in <a href="./1913.html">1913</a> with J. Franklin Collins in charge. Its special purpose was the study of the diseases of shade and ornamental trees and shrubs. In <a href="./1913.html">1913</a> Collins also rejoined the faculty as demonstrator in botany. York left for West Virginia, and <a href="./Snell, Walter H..html">Walter H. Snell</a> ’13, who had been assistant in botany in <a href="./1915.html">1915</a>-16 and instructor in <a href="./1919.html">1919</a>-20, took his place. The greenhouse was removed for the building of <a href="./Littlefield Hall.html">Littlefield Hall</a> in <a href="./1925.html">1925</a> and replaced by another one built to the east of <a href="./Maxcy Hall.html">Maxcy Hall</a>. A new greenhouse was acquired from government surplus in <a href="./1947.html">1947</a>. George L. Church joined the department as instructor in <a href="./1928.html">1928</a>, became assistant professor in <a href="./1934.html">1934</a>, associate professor in <a href="./1946.html">1946</a>, and professor in <a href="./1951.html">1951</a>. Professor Hubert J. Dyer came in <a href="./1950.html">1950</a>. Professor Snell was named Stephen T. Olney Professor in <a href="./1942.html">1942</a>. He retired in <a href="./1959.html">1959</a>, and Professor Church became chairman of the department in <a href="./1958.html">1958</a>. In <a href="./1965.html">1965</a> the Departments of Botany and <a href="./Biology.html">Biology</a> and the Division of Medical Science were merged into the Division of Biological and Medical Sciences.</p>
