Describing Howell, Professor William G. Goddard wrote:</p><blockquote>“ldquo;Judge Howell was endowed with extraordinary talents, and he superadded to his endowments extensive and accurate learning. An able jurist, he established for himself a solid reputation. He was, however, yet more distinguished as a keen and brilliant wit, and as a scholar extensively acquainted not only with the ancient, but with several of the modern languages. As a pungent and effective political writer, he was almost unrivalled; and in conversation, whatever chanced to be the theme, whether politics or law, literature or theology, grammar or criticism, a Greek tragedy or a difficult problem in mathematics, he was never found wanting.”rdquo;</blockquote>
