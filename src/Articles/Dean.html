Stoltz</a> was named to the office. <a href="./President.html">President</a> Keeney explained that “ldquo;Dean Stoltz will work with me on those aspects of the University that relate directly to education and the substance of research. ... The intention is not to interpose Dean Stoltz between the <a href="./President.html">President</a> and the Deans and the <a href="./Faculty.html">Faculty</a>, but to juxtapose him beside the <a href="./President.html">President</a> in order to extend the competence of that office.”rdquo;</p><p>In <a href="./1965.html">1965</a> at a junior convocation <a href="./President.html">President</a> <a href="./Keeney, Barnaby C..html">Barnaby Keeney</a> in a speech on campus communication had occasion to discuss the function of deans. The occasion was an appeal to the <a href="./Corporation.html">Corporation</a>, charging “ldquo;lack of communication,”rdquo; by students who were dissatisfied with the response of the president and deans to their campaign to have parietal rules liberalized. Keeney said, “ldquo;the business of the Deans is to form and administer the rules for activities, the curriculum, and other matters of business relating to the students. I see the Deans quite frequently, some of them every day. They tell me what they have in mind, and they usually tell me what other people have in mind.... the Deans, in effect, stand between the <a href="./President.html">President</a> and the students. Generally speaking, the Deans are apt to have a more liberal point of view than the <a href="./President.html">President</a>, if only because they are likely to be younger, and to sympathize more with students, if only because they are more thoroughly involved with them. ... Be kind to your Deans; they are good Deans, and there is a lot of good wear left in them. Do not attempt to undermine their position between you and the <a href="./President.html">President</a>, but rather sympathize with them, for both of the layers between which they are ground can be very nasty indeed.”rdquo;</p><p>Robert O.
