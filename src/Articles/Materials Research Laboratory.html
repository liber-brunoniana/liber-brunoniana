<p>The Materials Research Laboratory, devoted to the study of the capabilities of existing materials and the search for new types of materials, was established in <a href="articles/1962.html">1962</a>. The Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Defense Department (ARPA) entered a $3.5 million contract with Brown in <a href="articles/1961.html">1961</a> for materials research to be conducted by the Departments of <a href="articles/Chemistry.html">Chemistry</a> and <a href="articles/Physics.html">Physics</a> and the Divisions of Applied <a href="articles/Mathematics.html">Mathematics</a> and <a href="articles/Engineering.html">Engineering</a>. <a href="articles/Chemistry.html">Chemistry</a> professor Robert H. Cole was appointed coordinator of the program with engineering professor Gerald Heller as associate. In <a href="articles/1969.html">1969</a> Heller became director of the Laboratory with physics professor Charles Elbaum as associate director. In <a href="articles/1967.html">1967</a> ARPA initiated a program which brought together twelve major universities in a cooperative search for new materials with “super-properties.” The other institutions in the program were Cornell, Harvard, M.I.T., Northwestern, Princeton, Purdue, Stanford, and the Universities of Chicago, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. The five departments involved in the program are <a href="articles/Engineering.html">Engineering</a>, <a href="articles/Physics.html">Physics</a>, <a href="articles/Chemistry.html">Chemistry</a>, Applied <a href="articles/Mathematics.html">Mathematics</a>, and <a href="articles/Geology.html">Geology</a>. In <a href="articles/1973.html">1973</a> the National Science Foundation took over funding of the laboratory and directed the definition of specific targets of its research. Four major areas of research were defined: Fracture of solids, led by engineering professor James E. Rice, – Microscopic and macroscopic dynamic plasticity, under engineering professor Rodney J. Clifton – Inorganic gasses, under chemistry professor William M. Risen – Chemisorption and related surface interactions, coordinated by physics professor Peder J. Estrup. In <a href="articles/1977.html">1977</a> the laboratory was awarded a three-year $4.72 million grant from the National Science Foundation to explore the development of lightweight high-strength metals resistant to corrosion and extreme temperatures, and electronic materials for lasers and solar cells.</p>
