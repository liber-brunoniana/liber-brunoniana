<p>Egyptology was established as a department of study in <a href="./1948.html">1948</a> through the will of Theodora Wilbour, who had died in <a href="./1947.html">1947</a>, leaving $750,000 to start the department and endow a chair in Egyptology in memory of her father, Charles Edwin Wilbour <a href="./1854.html">1854</a>.</p><p>Wilbour had left Brown without graduating, and had apparently not maintained any connection with the University. In <a href="./1854.html">1854</a> he went to work for the <i>New York Herald Tribune.</i> Helped along by Horace Greeley, he made friends, among them <a href="./Marcy, William L..html">William Marcy</a> “ldquo;Boss”rdquo; Tweed, who lured Wilbour away to work for the <i>New York Transcript.</i> Wilbour was also employed simultaneously by the city of New York as stenographer in the Bureau of Elections and in the Superior Court and also as Examiner of Accounts. When the Tweed ring was smashed in <a href="./1871.html">1871</a>, Wilbour and his family sailed for France. In Paris he met Egyptologist Gaston Maspero, and was encouraged to study Egyptology. In <a href="./1880.html">1880</a> he began his visits to Egypt, and in <a href="./1886.html">1886</a> acquired his own sailing dahabiyeh, named “ldquo;The Seven Hathors,”rdquo; in which he and his family sailed on the Nile in the winters. They spent the summers in Paris, New York, or Little Compton. Wilbour, although respected by his fellow Egyptologists, studied for his own pleasure and chose never to publish any of his research. He died in <a href="./1897.html">1897</a>. Professor Richard Parker was brought from the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago to become the first Wilbour Professor of Egyptology. Parker left Luxor, Egypt, where he was field director of the Epigraphic Survey of the Oriental Institute to come to Brown. In <a href="./1951.html">1951</a> Parker instituted a visiting scholar program, which in the next ten years brought scholars from England, Egypt, Israel, France, and Belgium to Brown. In <a href="./1952.html">1952</a> Ricardó Caminos, who had studied under Parker in Chicago, became the second member of the Egyptology faculty. Caroline Nestman Peck, who received the first graduate degree in Egyptology in <a href="./1958.html">1958</a>, was the third. Richard H. Pierce ’57 received the second graduate degree in <a href="./1963.html">1963</a>. Caminos became chairman of the department in <a href="./1972.html">1972</a>, when Parker retired, and was in turn succeeded by Leonard H. Lesko in <a href="./1981.html">1981</a>. The department offers courses in the language, history, religion, and culture of ancient Egypt.</p>
