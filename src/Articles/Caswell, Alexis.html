<p>Alexis Caswell (<a href="articles/1799.html">1799</a>-<a href="articles/1877.html">1877</a>), sixth president of Brown University, was born in Taunton, Massachusetts, on January 29, <a href="articles/1799.html">1799</a>, with his twin brother Alvaris. He was descended from Thomas Caswell, one of the first settlers of Taunton, but, according to later family members, he was <i>not,</i> as has been frequently recorded, descended from Peregrine White, who was born on the Mayflower. He studied at Taunton Academy and graduated first in the class of <a href="articles/1822.html">1822</a> at Brown. He then became a tutor at Columbian College (now <a href="articles/Washington, George.html">George Washington</a> University) in Washington and studied theology with its president, William Staughton. In <a href="articles/1827.html">1827</a> he was ordained and installed as minister of a Baptist church in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Called to Providence to aid the ailing Stephen Gano at the <a href="articles/First Baptist Church.html">First Baptist Church</a>, he arrived just before Gano’s death and served temporarily as its minister. At this time <a href="articles/Woods, Alva.html">Alva Woods</a> resigned his professorship at Brown and Caswell took his place. He was professor of mathematics and natural philosophy from <a href="articles/1828.html">1828</a> to <a href="articles/1850.html">1850</a>, professor of mathematics and astronomy from <a href="articles/1850.html">1850</a> to <a href="articles/1855.html">1855</a>, and professor of natural philosophy and astronomy from <a href="articles/1855.html">1855</a> to <a href="articles/1863.html">1863</a>. When required he also taught ethics and constitutional law. He was involved in the creation of the museum of natural history and the raising of the library fund of $25,000 in <a href="articles/1831.html">1831</a>. He served as president <i>pro tempore</i> of the University in <a href="articles/1840.html">1840</a>-41 while <a href="articles/President.html">President</a> <a href="articles/Wayland, Francis.html">Francis Wayland</a> traveled in Europe, and was appointed regent of the University to assist the president from <a href="articles/1852.html">1852</a> to <a href="articles/1855.html">1855</a>. When Wayland resigned in <a href="articles/1855.html">1855</a>, some expected that Caswell, then the senior member of the faculty, would succeed him, but it was decided that a new president from outside the University would be an advantage, and <a href="articles/Sears, Barnas.html">Barnas Sears</a> was chosen. Caswell continued his teaching, spending the year <a href="articles/1860.html">1860</a>-61 visiting observatories and attending meetings of scientific societies. In <a href="articles/1863.html">1863</a> he retired and became president of the National Exchange Bank and the American Screw Company in Providence.</p><p>In <a href="articles/1868.html">1868</a>, after both Martin B. Anderson and <a href="articles/Robinson, Ezekiel Gilman.html">Ezekiel Gilman Robinson</a> had declined the offer of the presidency of Brown University, Caswell was persuaded to accept the office. He was at that time 69 years old and a vigorous presidency was not expected. There was, however, progress during his four years in office. The funds of the College increased from $327,000 to $602,000. <a href="articles/Tuition.html">Tuition</a> was raised, as were faculty salaries. The enrollment increased from 186 in <a href="articles/1868.html">1868</a> to 224 in <a href="articles/1872.html">1872</a>. Caswell revived the alumni association by inviting the alumni to meet with him on the day before <a href="articles/Commencement.html">Commencement</a> in <a href="articles/1868.html">1868</a>. After that, annual meetings were held and led to a permanent association in <a href="articles/1872.html">1872</a>. Caswell’s administration also saw an increase in intercollegiate competition in baseball and boating. He was not required to teach, and <a href="articles/Chace, George Ide.html">George Ide Chace</a> continued to teach moral and intellectual philosophy, which traditionally were the subjects taught by the president. In September <a href="articles/1868.html">1868</a> an Advisory and Executive Committee was created and empowered “to give to the <a href="articles/President.html">President</a> the assistance of their counsel when it is desired by him ... to act on occasions of emergency ... to see that the Laws of the <a href="articles/Corporation.html">Corporation</a> are carried into effect by the officers, and observed by the students.” Caswell resigned in <a href="articles/1872.html">1872</a> at the age of 73, having, in the words of Professor <a href="articles/Lincoln, John Larkin.html">John Larkin Lincoln</a>, “administered the Presidential office in a spirit of manly independence, and stood firmly, at whatever cost of personal convenience and personal interest, to the responsibilities which devolved upon him.”</p><p>Beginning in <a href="articles/1831.html">1831</a> Caswell made regular meteorological observations for Providence, and his “Meteorological Register; Providence, R.I.” from <a href="articles/1831.html">1831</a> to <a href="articles/1860.html">1860</a> was published in volume 12 of <i>Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.</i> He continued his observations until <a href="articles/1876.html">1876</a>. His obituary notice in the “Brown University Necrology” noted, “He had no taste for the preparation of text-books. The few productions of his pen which have been printed have appeared for the most part in scientific or literary magazines, or in the annual reports of learned societies.” In <a href="articles/1858.html">1858</a> he delivered a course of lectures at the Smithsonian Institution. He was named a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in <a href="articles/1858.html">1858</a>. When the National Academy of Science was created in <a href="articles/1863.html">1863</a>, Caswell was one the fifty members chosen. He was vice-president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in <a href="articles/1855.html">1855</a>, and at the meeting in <a href="articles/1858.html">1858</a> presided in the absence of the president and vice-president.
